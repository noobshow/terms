<section>
These Stripe Checkout User Terms of Service are a legal agreement between Stripe Payments Europe, Ltd. ("Stripe," "we" or "us") and you, the user of the Stripe Checkout service ("you").  By using the Stripe Checkout service, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions.

## 1. General

The Stripe Checkout service ("Stripe Checkout") is technology that makes it easier for merchants on the Internet ("Merchants") to collect payment from individuals like you.  Stripe Checkout also makes it easy for you to store a credit card or debit card ("Payment Credentials") with Stripe for use across the websites of Merchants who've chosen to enable it.

## 2. Using Stripe Checkout

When you check out on the website of a Merchant that has Stripe Checkout enabled, we will ask you if you'd like us to remember you.  When you allow us to remember you, Stripe will store certain identifying information, such as a password, your email address, or your mobile phone number ("Stripe Credentials"), and your Payment Credentials.  The advantage of remembering you is that it will make your checkout quicker and easier if you come back to the same website, or to any of the other websites that use Stripe (a "Checkout Enabled Site")--this can be especially handy when you're on a mobile device or don't have your credit card in front of you.

If you elect to allow us to remember you, Stripe will use cookies to link your web browser to your Stripe Credentials and recognize when you return to a Checkout Enabled Site. If you come to a Checkout Enabled Site and we don't recognize you (for example, because you've cleared your cookies, logged out, or you're using a different device), we will provide a way for you to identify yourself and login via your Stripe Credentials (for example, by sending you a verification code via SMS text message). While you are logged in, Stripe will give you the ability to make purchases using your stored Payment Credentials. Stripe may also allow you to make a purchase with your Payment Credentials by sending a message directly from the email address or phone number stored as your Stripe Credentials (for example, to authorize a purchase via SMS).

If you send us text messages, or have us send you one, don't forget that your carrier might charge you for that.

## 3. Our Role

Stripe Checkout is a way of storing your Payment Credentials, but it doesn't change anything else about your relationship with the Merchant you're paying or your bank or credit card company.  You are ultimately responsible for the purchases you make using Stripe Checkout.  Also, the Merchant is the one responsible for providing you the goods or services that you purchase using Stripe Checkout, not Stripe.  Stripe will use our reasonable efforts to keep your Payment Credentials secure.

## 4. Making Changes

If you want to delete your Payment Credentials, stop storing information using Stripe Checkout, or change your settings, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:support@stripe.com">support@stripe.com</a>.

## 5. Representations and Warranties

By using Stripe Checkout you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age and that you will not use Stripe Checkout for any fraudulent, unlawful or abusive purpose.

## 6. DISCLAIMERS

STRIPE CHECKOUT, INCLUDING ALL CONTENT, SOFTWARE, FUNCTIONS, MATERIALS, AND INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE ON, PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH OR ACCESSIBLE THROUGH STRIPE CHECKOUT, ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, STRIPE, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR AGENTS, MERCHANTS OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS (THE "DISCLAIMING ENTITIES"), MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER FOR THE SERVICES OR THE CONTENT, MATERIALS, INFORMATION AND FUNCTIONS MADE ACCESSIBLE BY STRIPE CHECKOUT, OR FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION THROUGH STRIPE CHECKOUT.

## 7. Limitations of Liability; Force Majeure

IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY DISCLAIMING ENTITY BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY, DAMAGES OR LOSSES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES WHICH MAY BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISCLAIMING ENTITY OR THE SERVICES, OR ANY GOODS, SERVICES, OR INFORMATION PURCHASED, RECEIVED, SOLD, OR PAID FOR BY WAY OF THE SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF CLAIM OR THE NATURE OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION, EVEN IF THE DISCLAIMING ENTITY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE OR LOSS. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DISCLAIMING ENTITIES' TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO these Terms of Service EXCEED $10 US Dollars.
