# About our terms of service

Welcome to Stripe. We developed this payment service (the “Service”) to make it easy for you to accept credit and debit card payments online from your customers so you can focus on your own product or service.

We have tried to draft these Merchant Terms of Service to be readable to people like us. Unfortunately, the realities of the legal world make it a very difficult task. So, should you have any questions or concerns or would simply like to better understand how we do things at Stripe, please do not hesitate to [contact us](https://stripe.com/help/contact).

Below is a quick description of the sections in this Agreement, but there are important details in the whole document, so you should read it.

# The Stripe Service

We provide you with software and a service to process your online credit and debit card payments; we will respect and protect your privacy, data and personal information. You run your business, service your customers, protect your customers’ data, report & pay taxes, and observe all laws, rules, and regulations. <a href="#section_a" class="arrow">Complete details</a>

# Registering for Stripe

You provide us with basic information about your company; we will seek to verify your information (we may work with third parties to do so) and approve your service account unless deemed risky (by us or our payment processors). You give us permission to do all this, and to periodically update the information or we otherwise must decline to offer you the service. <a href="#section_b" class="arrow">Complete details</a>

# Receiving your Funds from Card Transactions

We pay you for your transactions (minus our fees), at a schedule communicated to you once your use of Stripe is approved. (Payouts for your card transactions are typically sent to your bank within 7 days). A certain amount of your funds may be subject to an additional hold period (e.g. Reserve Account) with terms determined by your perceived risk and transaction history. You are responsible for refunds, returns, and liable for customer disputes (chargebacks). <a href="#section_c" class="arrow">Complete details</a>


# Termination and Other Legal Terms

We can terminate this agreement at any time (especially if you do something bad). You can also terminate anytime. Termination is effective immediately. Termination does not alter your liability for processed payments or related chargebacks. This section also includes all the extra legal stuff they make us add (e.g. indemnification, warranties, assignment). <a href="#section_d" class="arrow">Complete details</a>

# Stripe Terms of Service

The Terms and Conditions described here constitute a legal agreement (“Agreement”) between the sole proprietor or business organization listed as the “Merchant” on the Service registration page (sometimes referred to as “you,” “your”, “user”), Stripe, Inc. (“Stripe”), and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”, collectively with Stripe referred as “we”, “our” or “us”).

<h1 id="section_a">Section A: The Stripe Service</h1>

1. ## Our Role

    Our Service helps you accept and process credit card, debit card and other types of card payments (collectively “cards”) from your customers who want to pay you for products or services or to give you a donation. Stripe is not a bank or a money services business (“MSB”) and Stripe does not offer banking or MSB services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury. In addition, we do not assume any liability for the products or services purchased using our Service. You will be required to register with Stripe to use the Stripe Service (see Registering for Stripe).

2. ## Our Software

    We provide the Stripe API and other software to enable you to use the Service. We reserve the right to require you install or update any and all software updates to continue using the Service. Our Service also includes software to help you manage recurring and subscription billing charges for your products and services. It is your responsibility to obtain your customers’ consent to be billed on a recurring basis in compliance with applicable legal requirements and Card Network payment rules.

3. ## Authorization for Handling of Funds

    By accepting this agreement, you authorize us to hold, receive, and disburse funds on your behalf when such funds from your card transactions settle from the Card Networks. You further authorize Stripe to instruct Wells Fargo in the manner of how your card transaction settlement funds should be disbursed to you (such as by ACH credit transaction or sending you a paper check payable to you) and the timing of such disbursements. You also authorize Wells Fargo and/or Stripe to hold settlement funds in a deposit account at Wells Fargo pending disbursement of the funds to you in accordance with the terms of this contract. You agree that you are not entitled to any interest or other compensation associated with the settlement funds held in the deposit account at Wells Fargo pending settlement to your designated bank settlement account, that you have no right to direct that deposit account, and that you may not assign any interest in the deposit account at Wells Fargo. We may periodically make available to you information in the Stripe management dashboard regarding anticipated settlement amounts that we have received on your behalf from the Card Networks and are being held by us pending settlement. This settlement information does not constitute a deposit or other obligation of Stripe or Wells Fargo to you. This settlement information reflected in the Stripe management dashboard is for reporting and informational purposes only, and you are not entitled to, and have no ownership or other rights in settlement funds, until such funds are credited to your designated bank settlement account. Your authorizations set forth herein will remain in full force and effect until your Stripe account is closed or terminated.

4. ## Payment Methods

    Stripe’s card processing service supports any US-issued card and most non-US issued cards with a Visa, MasterCard, Discover, or American Express logo (collectively “the Card Networks”) including credit, debit, pre-paid, or gift cards. Stripe will only process card transactions that have been authorized by the applicable Card Network or card issuer. You are solely responsible for verifying identity of your users and determining their eligibility to purchase your products and services. Stripe does not guarantee or assume any liability for transactions authorized and completed which may later be reversed or chargedback (see Chargebacks below). You are solely responsible for all reversed or chargedback transactions, regardless of the reason for, or timing of, the reversal or chargeback. Stripe may add or remove one or more types of cards as supported payment card any time.  If we do so we will use reasonable efforts to give you prior notice of the removal.

5. ## Customer Service

    We will provide you with customer service to resolve any issues relating to your Stripe account, your card payment processing and use of our software, and the distribution of funds to your designated bank settlement account. You, and you alone, are responsible for providing service to your customers for any and all issues related to your products and services, including but not limited to issues arising from the processing of customers’ cards through the Service.

6. ## Taxes

    It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the sale of your goods and services and/or the payments you receive in connection with your use of the Service (“Taxes”). It is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report, or remit the correct tax to the proper tax authority. We are not obligated to, nor will we determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction. You acknowledge that we may make certain reports to tax authorities regarding transactions that we process and merchants to which we provide card payment services.

    Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, merchant acquiring entities and third party settlement organizations are required to file an information return with the IRS for each calendar year, reporting all payment card transactions and third party network transactions with merchants occurring in that calendar year. You acknowledge that we will report to the Internal Revenue Service the total amount of the payments you receive each calendar year as required by law.

7. ## Security

    Stripe is responsible for protecting the security of Card Data in our possession and will maintain  commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect all the personal information regarding you and your customers that is stored in our servers from unauthorized access and accidental loss or modification. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use such personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide this personal information regarding you and your customers at your own risk. We recommend you review our Privacy Policy, which will help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us.

8. ## Data Security

    You are fully responsible for the security of data on your website or otherwise in your possession. You agree to comply with all applicable state and federal laws and rules in connection with your collection, security and dissemination of any personal, financial, Card, or transaction information (defined as “Data”) on your website. You agree that at all times you shall be compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) and the Payment Application Data Security Standards (PA-DSS), as applicable. The steps you will need to take to comply with PCI-DSS and PA-DSS when using Stripe will vary based on your implementation.  For more information about implementing Stripe, please refer to our Documentation.  If we believe it is necessary based on your implementation and request it of you, you will promptly provide us with documentation evidencing your compliance with PCI DSS and/or PA DSS if requested by us. You also agree that you will use only PCI compliant service providers in connection with the storage, or transmission of Card Data defined as a cardholder’s account number, expiration date, and CVV2. You must not store CVV2 data at any time. Information on the PCI DSS can be found on the PCI Council’s <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org">website</a>. It is your responsibility to comply with these standards.

9. ## Audit Right

    If we believe that a security breach or compromise of data has occurred, Stripe may require you to have a third party auditor that is approved by Stripe conduct a security audit of your systems and facilities and issue a report to be provided to Stripe, financial banks, and the Payment Networks.

10. ## Your Privacy

	Your privacy and the protection of your data are very important to us. You acknowledge that you have received, read in full and agree with the terms of our Privacy Policy (https://stripe.com/privacy) linked to and incorporated into this Agreement by reference, which contains your consent to our collection, use, retention and disclosure of personal information as well as other matters set forth therein and which explains how and for what purposes we collect, use, retain, disclose and safeguard the information you provide to us. You also acknowledge that we or our payment processor is required to report your business name and the name of your principals to the MATCHTM listing maintained by MasterCard and accessed and updated by Visa and American Express or to the Consortium Merchant Negative File maintained by Discover, if applicable, pursuant to the requirements of the Network Rules.  You specifically consent to the fulfillment of the obligations related to the listing by us or our payment processor and to the listing itself and you waive and hold harmless us or our payment processor from all claims and liabilities you may have as a result of such reporting.

11. ## Privacy of Others

    You represent to Stripe that you are in compliance with all applicable privacy laws, you have obtained all necessary rights and consents under applicable law to disclose to Stripe, or allow Stripe to collect, use, retain and disclose any Cardholder Data that you provide to us or authorize us to collect, including information that we may collect directly from your end users via cookies or other means.  As between you and Stripe, you are solely responsible for disclosing to your customers that Stripe is processing credit card transactions for you and obtaining Data from such customers.

    If you receive information about others, including Cardholders, through the use of the Service, you must keep such information confidential and only use it in connection with the Service.   You may not disclose or distribute any such information to a third party or use any such information for marketing purposes unless you receive the express consent of the user to do so.  You may not disclose card information to any third party, other than in connection with processing a card transaction requested by your customer under the Service and in a manner consistent with PCI DSS and applicable law.

12. ## Restricted Use

    You are required to obey all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to your use of the Service (for example, those governing financial services, consumer protections, unfair competition, anti-discrimination or false advertising). In addition to any other requirements or restrictions set forth in this Agreement, you shall not: (i) utilize the credit available on any Card to provide cash advances to Cardholders,(ii) submit any card transaction for processing that does not arise from your sale of goods or service to a buyer customer, or acceptance of a bona fide charitable donation, (iii) act as a payment intermediary or aggregator or otherwise resell our services on behalf of any third party, (iv) send what you believe to be potentially fraudulent authorizations or fraudulent card transaction, or (v) use Stripe in a manner that Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover or any other Card Network or other payment network reasonably believes to be an abuse of such network or a violation of its applicable rules.

    You further agree not to, nor to permit any third party to, do any of the following: (i) access or attempt to access Stripe systems, programs or data that are not made available for public use; (ii) copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, resell or distribute in any way material from Stripe; (iii) permit any third party to use and benefit from the Service via a rental, lease, timesharing, service bureau or other arrangement; (iv) transfer any rights granted to you under this Agreement; (v) work around any of the technical limitations of the Service, use any tool to enable features or functionalities that are otherwise disabled in the Service, or decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the Service, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (vi) perform or attempt to perform any actions that would interfere with the proper working of the Service, prevent access to or use of the Service by our other users, or impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; or (vii) otherwise use the Service except as expressly allowed under this section.

13. ## Suspicion of Unauthorized or Illegal Use

    We reserve the right to not authorize or settle any transaction you submit which we believe is in violation of this Agreement, any other Stripe agreement, or exposes you, other Stripe users, our processors or Stripe to harm, including but not limited to fraud and other criminal acts. You are hereby granting us authorization to share information with law enforcement about you, your transactions, or your Stripe Service Account if we reasonably suspect that your use of Stripe has been for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose.

14. ## Card Network Rules

    The Networks have established guidelines, bylaws, rules, and regulations (“Network Rules”). You are required to comply with all applicable Network Rules that are applicable to merchants. You can review portions of the Network rules at <a href='http://usa.visa.com/merchants/operations/op_regulations.html'>Visa</a> and <a href="http://www.mastercard.com/us/merchant/support/rules.html">MasterCard</a>. The Networks reserve the right to amend the Network Rules. Stripe reserves the right to amend the Agreement at any time with notice to you as necessary to comply with Network Rules or otherwise address changes in the Service.

15. ## Disclosures and Notices

    You agree that Stripe can provide disclosures and notices regarding the Service to you by posting such disclosures and notices on our website, emailing them to the email address listed in your Stripe account, or mailing them to the address listed in your Stripe Service Account.

Such disclosures and notices shall be considered to be received by you within 24 hours of the time it is posted to our website or emailed to you unless we receive notice that the email was not delivered.

16.	## References to Our Relationship

You agree that, from the time you begin processing payment with Stripe until you terminate your account with us, we may identify you as a customer of Stripe.   Neither you nor we will imply any untrue sponsorship, endorsement or affiliation between you and Stripe.


<h1 id="section_b">Section B: Registering for Stripe</h1>

1. ## Registration

    The Stripe Service is only made available under this Agreement to persons in the United States that operate a business selling goods or services, or to accept donations for a bona fide charitable organization, and the Stripe Service is not made available to persons to accept card payments for personal, family or household purposes. To use Stripe to receive payments, you will first have to register.

To sign up a business to use the Service, you must agree to this Agreement on behalf of the business. If you have so agreed, the term “you” will mean you, the natural person, as well as the business organization that you represent.

    As part of your registration, you must provide your site URL (e.g. www.mystore.com) and the name under which you do business (which may be the business’s legal name or a “doing business name”) (e.g. MyStore Online Widgets). These two fields may appear in your customers’ credit or debit card statements. To avoid customer confusion and transaction disputes, you must enter a description that clearly identifies your business as well as an accurate site URL.

In that case, unless you expressly inform us in writing otherwise, you hereby authorize Stripe to continue to manage your American Express account on your behalf and to cause funds settled from American Express transactions to be deposited to an omnibus bank account designated by Stripe for your benefit.

    After we have collected and verified all your information, Stripe will review your account and determine if you are eligible to use the Service. Stripe may also share your information with our payment processors (such as Wells Fargo), each of which may also make a determination regarding your eligibility. We will notify you once your account has been either approved or deemed ineligible for use of the Service.

    By accepting the terms of this Agreement, you are providing us with authorization to retrieve information about you by using third parties, including credit bureaus and other information providers. You acknowledge that such information retrieved may include your name, address history, credit history, and other data about you. Stripe may periodically update this information to determine whether you continue to meet our eligibility requirements.

    You agree that Stripe is permitted to contact and share information about you and your application (including whether you are approved or declined), and your use of Stripe with the payment processor, including Wells Fargo. This includes sharing information (a) about your transactions for regulatory or compliance purposes, (b) for use in connection with the management and maintenance of the program, (c) to create and update their customer records about you and to assist them in better serving you, and (d) to conduct Stripe’s risk management process.

<h1 id="section_c">Section C: Processing Card Transactions and Receiving Your Funds</h1>

1. ## Processing Card Transactions

    You agree that you will honor all eligible cards presented for payment by your customers for your goods and services in accordance with the Card Network rules, this Agreement and any operating guides that we may provide you from time to time. You agree that you will obtain an authorization from the Card Network(s) for each card transaction, as required under the Card Networks’ rules, and will not submit a card transaction for settlement where there is a negative authorization or the card is otherwise expired. You acknowledge that the existence of an affirmative authorization from us or the Card Networks does not mean that a particular card transaction will not be subject to Chargeback, Reversal or Claim at a later date.

    You will not impose any fee or surcharge on a customer that seeks to use an eligible payment card. You will provide a receipt to the customer at the conclusion of the purchase transaction that includes all information required under Card Network rules and applicable law.

    You will submit all card transactions for processing no later than three (3) days from the date of authorization. You will maintain appropriate records of all card transactions for a period of at least two (2) years from the date of the transaction.

    You will display all Card Network marks in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Card Networks, and will use such marks only to indicate that you accept their cards for payment.

2. ## Payouts and Transaction History

    We will pay out funds settling from the Card Networks to your designated bank settlement account in the amounts actually received (less our Fees as defined below) for card transactions submitted to our Service. The payouts will be made to the bank account (“Bank Account”) you provide for your Stripe Service Account. The Bank Account must be an account located at bank in the United States and held in the name of the business. You are responsible for the accuracy and correctness of information regarding your Bank Account. Funds for any given transaction will not be transferred to your Bank Account until the transaction is deemed complete. Transactions will be deemed complete when we have received funds settling from the Card Networks and when we or our processing financial institutions have accepted such funds. The actual timing of the transfers to your Bank Account of the settling funds will be subject to the Payout Schedule as defined below.

    After each payout of card settlement funds to your Bank Account, we will update information in your Stripe Service Account to reflect settlement. Information regarding your card transactions processed and settled with the Services (“Transaction History”) will be available to you when you login to our website using your Stripe Service Account. We provide a minimum of one year of Transaction History on our website. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Stripe Service Account, your Transaction History and your use of the Service.

3. ## Payout Schedule

    Payout schedule refers to the time it takes for us to initiate a transfer to your designated Bank Account of settlement funds arising from card transactions processed through the Service (“Payout Schedule”). Once your bank account information has been reviewed, Stripe will initiate transfer of settlement funds (net of Fees, chargebacks, and other funds owed to us for any reason) in accordance with the Payout Schedule, the terms of which will be made available to you when you login to your Stripe management dashboard. The settlement funds should normally be credited to your Bank Account within 1-2 days of us initiating the payout. We are not responsible for any action taken by the institution holding your Bank Account that may result in some or all of the funds not being credited to your Bank Account or not being made available to you in your Bank Account. You can contact Stripe to inquire about changing the timing of your Payout Schedule. Upon submitting a request, you will be informed of the process and requirements for Stripe to review your Payout Schedule.

    Stripe and/or Wells Fargo reserves the right to change the Payout Schedule or suspend payouts to your Bank Account should we determine it is necessary due to pending disputes, excessive or anticipated excessive Chargebacks or refunds, or other suspicious activity associated with your use of the Service or if required by law or court order.

4. ## Transfer Creation API

    If you use the Stripe transfer creation application programming interface or other functionality provided by Stripe that helps you to transfer your funds to third parties (collectively, the “Transfer Creation API”), the terms of this Section 4 apply to you. 

    1. Available Funds. Stripe will indicate that particular funds are available for payout to you (“Available Funds”) in the Stripe Transfer API or in your Stripe account management dashboard, in accordance with the Stripe Terms of Service.  Available Funds will remain in an omnibus account for your benefit until paid out to you or your Recipient (as defined below) in accordance with your instructions, so you should promptly designate a Recipient.  You will not be entitled to receive interest on Available Funds.

    2. Designation of Recipients. As part of the Transfer Creation API, Stripe will provide you with the ability to designate third party recipients to whom you may transfer all or a portion of your Available Funds, by supplying certain required information (“Recipients”).  You are solely responsible for determining the accuracy and completeness of any payment instructions that you provide to Stripe using the Transfer Creation API.  By designating a Recipient to receive Available Funds, you represent and warrant to us that:

        1. you have verified the identity of the Recipient and the accuracy of the payment details associated with such Recipient;
        2. your transfer of Available Funds to the Recipient is not associated with any unlawful transaction or activity by you or the Recipient; and
        3. the Recipient is legally entitled to receive such Available Funds from you.

    3. Appointment as Agent. If you use the Transfer Creation API, you hereby appoint us as your agent to make payment of your Available Funds via ACH or other methods to your Recipients using our payment tools.  

    4. Commercial Use Only. The Transfer Creation API is solely for commercial use and you may not use it for any personal, family or household purposes.

    5. Taxes. As between you and us, unless we otherwise agree with you in writing or are otherwise required to do so by law, you are solely responsible for the filing of any tax disclosure forms associated with your payment of funds to the Recipient (including, e.g., 1099 forms).

    6. Identification of Recipients. You will take reasonable steps to verify the legal name of any Recipient you designate, and you will submit the verified name of each Recipient to us.  Such steps may include, for example, verifying a government issued identity from the Recipient, matching the recipient’s identity against reliable third party databases, or other methods that you reasonably believe will ensure that the identity of the Recipient that you provide us is accurate.  If we request it, you will promptly provide documentation of Recipient identification or your methods of determining identity, and otherwise cooperate with us reasonably so that may understand the identity of each Recipient.  We reserve the right to change the identification required for Recipients upon notice to you.

    7. Liability. Except for our obligation to make payments in accordance with instructions provided using your account credentials, we will have no liability of any kind in connection with the use of the Transfer Creation API.

5. ## Reconciliations and Errors

    Your Transaction History will be available to you when you login to the Stripe management dashboard. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for reconciling your Transaction History with your actual card payment transactions. You agree to notify us of any discrepancies arising from such reconciliation and verification. We will investigate any reported discrepancies and attempt to rectify any errors that you or we discover. In the event you are owed money as a result of the discrepancy, we will transfer funds to your Bank Account in the next scheduled payout. Your failure to notify us of a error or discrepancy in your Transaction History within sixty (60) days of when it first appears on your Transaction History will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you in connection with any such error or discrepancy in processing your card payments.

    If you submit or cause us to process transactions erroneously, you agree to contact us immediately. We will investigate any reported errors and attempt to rectify any errors that you or we discover by crediting or debiting your Bank Account as appropriate. Your failure to notify us of a processing error within thirty (30) days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.

6. ## Refunds and Returns

    By accepting these terms of service, you agree to submit any and all refunds and adjustments for returns of your products and services through the Stripe Service to the cardholders card in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and Network Rules. Network Rules require that you will (i) maintain a fair return, cancellation or adjustment policy; (ii) disclose your return or cancellation policy to customers at the time of purchase, (iii) not give cash refunds to a customer in connection with a Card sale, unless required by law, and (iv) not accept cash or any other item of value for preparing a Card sale refund.

    Full refunds must be for the exact dollar amount of the original transaction including tax, handling charges, and other. The refund amount may not exceed the original sale amount except by an amount equal to any reimbursements to customer for postage costs incurred for product returns. You will use best efforts to process all refunds within sixty (60) days after the original transaction date, and you acknowledge that refunds processed after that time may not be capable of being processed.

    For processed refunds, Stripe will deduct the refund amount (including any applicable Fees) from (i) settlement funds owed to you from processing of other card transactions, or (ii) funds in any Reserve Account. If these funds are not sufficient, you authorize Stripe to initiate an ACH debit entry to your Bank Account in the amount necessary to complete the refund transaction to the Cardholder’s card. In the event Stripe cannot access your Bank Account by means of ACH debit entry, you agree to pay all funds owed to Stripe upon demand. You are solely responsible for accepting and processing returns of your products and services; Stripe has no responsibility or obligation for processing such returns.

7. ## Chargebacks

    A Chargeback (defined below in Section D(6)) is typically caused when a customer disputes a charge that appears on their bill. A Chargeback may result in the reversal of a transaction, with the amount charged back to you. You can be assessed charge backs for: (i) customer disputes, or (ii) unauthorized or improperly authorized transactions, or (iii) transactions that do not comply with Network Rules or the terms of this Agreement or are allegedly unlawful or suspicious, or (iv) any reversals for any reason by the Network, our processor or acquiring bank, or the Cardholder bank.

    When a Chargeback is issued, you are immediately liable to Stripe for the full amount of payment of the Chargeback plus any associated Fees, fines, expenses or penalties (including those assessed by the Networks or our payment processors). You agree that Stripe may recover these amounts by debiting by means of ACH debit of your Bank Account associated with your Stripe account, debiting your Reserve Account, or setting off any amounts owed to you by us. If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you will pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of us in connection with the collection of any unpaid Chargebacks unpaid by you.

    Further, if we reasonably believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you under this Agreement until such time that: (a) a Chargeback is assessed due to a customer’s complaint, in which case we will retain the funds; (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the customer may dispute that the transaction has expired; or (c) we determine that a Chargeback on the transaction will not occur.

8. ## Contesting your Chargebacks

    You or Stripe may elect to contest Chargebacks assessed to your account. Stripe may provide you with assistance including notifications and software to help contest your Chargebacks. We do not assume any liability for our role or assistance in contesting Chargebacks.

    You agree to provide us with the necessary information, in a timely manner and at your expense, to investigate or help resolve any Chargeback. You also grant us permission to share records or other information required with the Cardholder, the Cardholder’s financial institution, and your financial institution to help resolve any disputes. You acknowledge that your failure to provide us with complete and accurate information in a timely manner may result in an irreversible Chargeback being assessed.

    If the Cardholder’s issuing bank or the Network does not resolve a dispute in your favor, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees from you as described in this Agreement.

    We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating or investigating Chargeback disputes.

9. ## Excessive Chargebacks

    At any point, Stripe, Wells Fargo, the Card Networks, or our payment processor(s) may determine that you are incurring excessive Chargebacks. Excessive Chargebacks may result in additional fees, penalties, or fines. Excessive Chargebacks may also result in additional controls and restrictions to your use of the Stripe Service, including without limitation, (i) changes to the terms of your Reserve Account, (ii) increases to your applicable Fees, (iii) delays in your Payout Schedule, or (iv) possible suspension or termination of your Stripe account and the Service. The Networks may also place additional controls or restrictions as part of their own monitoring programs for merchants with excessive Chargebacks.

10. ## Stripe Fees

    You agree to pay the Fees (“Fees”) assessed by us to you for providing the payment services described in this Agreement. These fees will be calculated pursuant to the [Fee Schedule](https://stripe.com/help/pricing) linked to here and incorporated into this Agreement by reference. We reserve the right to revise our Fees at any time, subject to a thirty (30) day notice period to you.

    You acknowledge that you are also responsible for any penalties or fines imposed on Stripe or directly to you by any Network or financial institution as a result of your activities.

11. ## Our Collection Rights

    To the extent permitted by law, we may collect any obligations you owe us under this Agreement by deducting the corresponding amounts from the Reserve Account or from funds payable to you arising from the settlement of card transactions. Fees will be assessed at the time a transaction is processed and will be first deducted from the funds received for such transactions. If the settlement amounts or Reserve Account are not sufficient to meet your obligations to us, we may charge or debit the bank account or credit card registered in your Stripe Service Account for any amounts owed to us. Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand will be a breach of this Agreement. You will be liable for our costs associated with collection in addition to the amount owed, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and expenses, costs of any arbitration or court proceeding, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.

    Additionally, we may require a personal guarantee from a principal of a business for funds owed under this Agreement.  If we require a personal guarantee we will specifically inform you in advance.

12. ## Reserves

    Funds in held in reserves are amounts of money set aside to cover Chargebacks, refunds, or other payment obligations under this agreement (a “Reserve Account”). Stripe, in its sole discretion, will set the terms of your Reserve Account and notify you of such terms, which may require that a certain amount (including the full amount) of the funds received for your transaction is held for a period of time or that additional amounts are held in Reserve Account. Stripe, in its sole discretion, may elect to change the terms of the Reserve Account at any time for any reason based on your payment processing history or as requested by our payment processors.

    Stripe may fund the Reserve Account by means of: (i) any funds payouts made or due to you for card transactions submitted to the service, or, or (ii) amounts available in your Bank Account by means of ACH debit to that Bank Account, or (iv) other sources of funds associated with your Stripe account; or (iv) requesting that you provide funds to Stripe for deposit to the Reserve Account.

13. ## Security Interest

    You grant us a lien and security interest in the Reserve Account, all Card transactions (including future Card transactions), any rights to receive credits or payments under this Agreement, and all deposits and other property of yours possessed or maintained by us on your behalf. You will execute, deliver, and pay the fees for any documents we request to create, perfect, maintain and enforce this security interest.
