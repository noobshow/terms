Furthermore, You shall not transmit any Personal Data in connection with Your Websites unless You use encryption to transmit such Personal Data.  Upon discovering a Security Breach, You will (i) promptly notify Apple thereof, (ii) investigate, remediate, and mitigate the effects of the Security Breach, and (iii) provide Apple with assurances reasonably satisfactory to Apple that such Security Breach will not recur.  Additionally, if and to the extent any Security Breach or other unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of Personal Data occurs as a result of an act or omission of You, Your Affiliates, or Your Platform Providers, and if notices or other related remedial measures (including notice, credit monitoring services, fraud insurance and the establishment of a call center to respond to customer inquiries) are reasonably warranted, You will, at Your cost and expense, upon Apple’s request, undertake such notices and remedial actions.  If Apple makes available new versions of the Apple Pay Web APIs to address a security breach or security vulnerability regarding Personal Data, then You agree to update all of Your Websites to incorporate such new version within a reasonable time period if requested to do so by Apple.
