<section>

This Peoples Trust Services Addendum ("Peoples Trust Addendum") to the Stripe Services Agreement ("Agreement") provides additional terms applicable to the Payment Services.  Any terms used but not defined in this Peoples Trust Addendum will have the meaning provided in the Agreement.

This Peoples Trust Addendum constitutes a legal agreement between you, Stripe, and Peoples Trust Company ("Peoples Trust"). In order to use the Payment Services provided through your Agreement with Stripe, you understand that Stripe or Peoples Trust may enforce any provisions of the Agreement that relate to your use of Payment Services provided in conjunction with Peoples Trust. Stripe or Peoples Trust may also terminate this Peoples Trust Addendum at any time, which may limit or terminate your ability to use Payment Services.

**You must accept all of the terms and conditions of this Addendum to use Services provided by Stripe. If you do not accept them, you may not use the Payment Services under this Peoples Trust Addendum.**

### 1. Purpose of this Addendum

When your customer pays you through Stripe, they have the option of paying you through a funding source offered on the Stripe website including a credit or debit card funded payment. Since you may be the recipient of a credit or debit card funded payment, Visa U.S.A., Inc. and Visa International ("Visa") and MasterCard International Incorporated ("MasterCard")(collectively, the "Networks") require that you enter into a direct contractual relationship with a bank that is a member of the Networks. However, by using Payment Services you are not establishing a depository or other account with Peoples Trust.

Peoples Trust is not responsible for the provision of any Payment Services by Stripe or your use of the Payment Services for your business. Peoples Trust is also not responsible for providing customer service to you to resolve any issues you may have related to your use of the Payment Services; however you may contact Peoples Trust at the address set forth in Section 13, in the event that you are unable to resolve any complaints directly with Stripe. You are solely responsible for providing support to your Customers for all issues related to your products and services.

### 2. Compliance with Network Rules

Where you use the Payment Services to accept Charges from payment cards, you will comply with the Network Rules and limitations on use identified in Agreement, including the Network Rules applicable to acceptance of MasterCard and Visa branded payment cards. These include guidelines, monitoring programs, and activity reporting (including excessive credits, chargebacks, or deposit). Under the Network Rules, certain activity may subject you to chargebacks, fees, fines, settlement delays, withholdings, audits of your processing activity, or termination of this Peoples Trust Addendum.

Without limiting the foregoing, you specifically agree to:

**a.** Only submit transactions authorized by the cardholder;

**b.** Only accept payment for the sale of products or services, and receipt of bona fide donations, conducted by you pursuant to your business as indicated on your application and not for any Prohibited Business;

**c.** Submit a transaction for the full amount owed by the Customer for the transaction except where you and the Customer agree on a partial shipment (such as receiving a portion of an order), or where the transaction qualifies for delayed delivery or special order deposits (such as paying for a deposit on a custom-built product);

**d.** Not establish minimum or maximum amounts (except as permitted by the Network Rules), or condition Charges for use of payment cards, and not discourage the use of one payment card brand over another;

**e.** Not impose surcharges or taxes (except where permitted by Law) and, where so done, you will only collect such amounts as part of the submitted Charge;

**f.** Use Networks' logos or marks in a manner permitted by the Network Rules;

**g.** Prohibit use of payment cards for disbursement of cash (except as permitted by the Network Rules);

**h.** Comply with the security obligations identified in the Agreement, including compliance with PCI-DSS and only using cardholder data as permitted, and will certify such compliance upon request, and not permit or promote fraudulent use of payment cards or cardholder data;

**i.** Make clear to Customers that they are transacting with you prior to, during, and after the transaction, including providing clear statement descriptors;

**j.** Use all reasonable methods to resolve disputes with your customers, including those resulting in a chargeback, and do not attempt to recharge a customer for the transaction unless authorized by the Customer; and

**k.** Provide clear refund and exchange language that is consistent with Laws and the Network Rules.

**l.** Accept the following card types; Visa Credit, Visa Debit, MasterCard Credit, Debit MasterCard. 

You acknowledge that, at their sole discretions, at any time, Peoples Trust Company and/or Payment Networks and/or Regulators may, either by themselves or through an agent, investigate, review, audit, or inspect your business, including by inspecting your premises and auditing your books, records, and procedures to ensure that you are complying with the Payment Network Charter Documents, Network Rules, and applicable brand and security standards and procedures, and operating in a safe and sound manner.

### 4. Term and Termination
