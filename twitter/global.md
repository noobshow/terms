    **"Twitter Service"** means, collectively, any products, platforms,
    features or services (in whole or in part) owned or operated by
    Twitter or any of its Affiliates.

2.  **PROGRAM SETUP AND OPERATION**

    1.  **Stripe Integration**. You agree that you will maintain your
        status as an activated customer of Stripe throughout the term of
        this Agreement. Further, you acknowledge and agree that your
        participation in, and use of, the Buy Now Program is dependent
        on your continued relationship with Stripe, and that if you
        cease to be an activated customer of Stripe, Twitter may suspend
        or terminate this Agreement and/or your access to the Buy Now
        Program immediately without notice. Subject to the terms of this
        Agreement, during the Term, Twitter will make the Buy Now
        Program (including the Buy Now Card) available to you.

    2.  **Order Fulfillment**. You are responsible for all fulfillment
        of purchased items (including without limitation shipping,
        returns and exchanges). You will promptly fulfill and ship each
        order made via Buy Now Program transactions on Twitter and will
        ensure that all purchased items are received by the customer
        within fourteen (14) days after the date on which the customer
        placed the order. You are responsible for charging, collecting,
        and remitting all applicable sales, use, excise, VAT and other
        similar tax that arises out of a fulfillment of any order to
        a customer.

    3.  **Customer Service***.* You are responsible for all customer
        service related to the applicable purchase, fulfillment, fraud
        and any claims, refunds, chargebacks, reversals or other
        unauthorized charges. In the event that Twitter receives any
        such customer service request and forwards such request to you,
        you agree to respond promptly to and address such request in the
        same manner as if such request had come directly to you. You
        will respond to each such customer service request (regardless
        of source) within one (1) business day of your initial receipt
        of such request.

    4.  **Policies***.* You will ensure that all items you enable for
        sale via the Buy Now Program, and your activities in relation to
        such items, comply with the Twitter Commerce Policy. For
        clarity, any Buy Now Program Tweet that you promote shall
        additionally be subject to Twitter’s then-current advertiser
        Master Services Agreement (found
        at https://ads.twitter.com/terms/us) (the "**MSA**") and ads
        policy (found at twitter.com/adspolicy) (the "**Twitter Ads
        Policy**"). If there is a conflict between the Twitter Commerce
        Policy and the Twitter Ads Policy, the Twitter Ads Policy will
        control, but only to the extent the Twitter Ads Policy is more
        restrictive than the Twitter Commerce Policy. If a product or
        service offered for sale through the Buy Now Program, or any
        related Company Content, is permitted under the Twitter Ads
        Policy (either explicitly or implicitly by omission) but is
        restricted under the Twitter Commerce Policy, the restriction in
        the Twitter Commerce Policy will continue to apply.

    5.  **Service Level Agreement**. Throughout the Term, you will
        maintain the following service levels: (i) the Merchant Platform
        will be available 99.9% of the time; (ii) the Merchant Platform
        will be able to process at least 50 transactions per second at
        all times, and you will increase such capacity to 100
        transactions per second within one (1) hour after receiving a
        request from Twitter to do so; and (iii) you will respond to
        Twitter within twenty (20) minutes during any technical site
        issues, including without limitation when the Merchant Platform
        is down or not responding, and you will at all times provide
        24x7 call-in support to Twitter, including both primary phone
        number and escalation phone number.

3.  **LICENSE AND OWNERSHIP.** In order to participate in the Buy Now
    Program, you grant Twitter a non-exclusive, license fee-free,
    royalty-free, worldwide license to: (a) use, copy, display, perform,
    adapt, reformat, recompile, truncate, and/or edit any part of the
    Merchant Content for public performance, public display, and
    distribution; and (b) access, index, and cache the website(s) to
    which any Merchant Content links, or any portion thereof, by any
    means, including web spiders and/or crawlers. You acknowledge and
    agree that, as between the parties, Twitter owns the Twitter
    Materials and, except as expressly set forth herein, Twitter
    reserves all rights in the Twitter Materials.

4.  **USE OF TWITTER MATERIALS.** Twitter Materials are being provided
    to you solely for the purpose of the Buy Now Program and for no
    other purpose. You will not: (a) interfere or attempt to interfere
    with the proper working of the Twitter Service or the Buy Now
    Program; or (b) reverse engineer, disassemble, reconstruct,
    decompile, copy, or create derivative works of the Buy Now Program,
    or any aspect or portion thereof (including the Buy Now Card). You
    may use Approved End User Data for targeted marketing or remarketing
    to end users, provided that you: (x) have an end user privacy policy
    prominently posted on your website (and, as applicable, mobile site
    and/or mobile app) that is at least as protective of the Approved
    End User Data as Twitter’s privacy policy (located at
    <https://twitter.com/privacy>) is of user information, and clearly
    discloses to end users how their information is collected, used and
    shared and, at minimum, complies with all applicable laws, rules or
    regulations; (y) comply with your above-referenced end user privacy
    policy; and (z) provide end users with a simple and obvious
    mechanism on your website (and, as applicable, mobile site and/or
    mobile app), and in any purchase confirmation email you send, for
    unsubscribing from any of your marketing lists (or of otherwise
    opting out of the applicable marketing activities). Except as
    expressly set forth herein, you shall not: (i) derive, collect
    and/or use any Twitter Materials, or any information, data or
    insights derived therefrom, for any internal or external purpose
    (including without limitation for purposes of targeted marketing or
    advertising); (ii) share the Twitter Materials with any third party
    (whether verbally or in writing), including without limitation any
    of your customers, clients or business partners, or any of your
    personnel unrelated to the Buy Now Program; or (iii) commingle any
    Twitter Materials with any Merchant Materials or any other
    third-party materials.

5.  **ADDITIONAL DATA USE RESTRICTIONS**. Some of the Twitter Materials
    may comprise user data controlled by Twitter International Company
    ("**TIC**"), an Irish registered company. TIC has authorized Twitter
    to make these disclosures on its behalf to the extent that they
    occur pursuant to this Agreement. The model contractual clauses
    annexed to European Commission Decision 2004/915/EC (the
    "**Clauses**") are hereby incorporated into this Agreement as if
    they have been set out in full herein. The Clauses shall apply only
    to TIC controlled personal data that is disclosed to you pursuant to
    this Agreement, if you are located or transfer or will transfer such
    personal data out of (a) the European Economic Area, or (b) a
    jurisdiction in which a Commission positive adequacy decision under
    Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC is in force and covers such
    a transfer. In such cases, TIC shall be the ‘data exporter’ and you
    shall be the ‘data importer’ as defined in the Clauses, and for the
    purposes of clause II(h) of the Clauses, you hereby select
    option (iii) and agree to be governed by and comply with the data
    processing principles set out in Annex A to the Clauses. For the
    purposes of Annex B to the Clauses, the following shall apply: (u)
    ‘Data subjects’ shall mean the registered users of the Twitter
    Service or individuals whose personal data is comprised in the
    Twitter Materials; (v) the ‘Purpose of the transfer(s)’ is the
    performance of this Agreement; (w) the ‘Categories of data’ are
    Twitter Materials; (x) the ‘Recipients’ are payment processors and
    other third parties (if any) that receive any such Twitter Materials
    in connection with this Agreement; (y) ‘Sensitive data’ shall mean
    personal data regarding an individual’s racial or ethnic origin,
    political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union
    membership, health or sex life, criminal convictions or alleged
    commission of an offence; and (z) the ‘contact points for data
    protection enquiries’ are the relevant individuals with
    responsibility for data privacy in each of Twitter and you.

6.  **FEEDBACK.**  You may provide comments, feedback, ideas,
    suggestions or other information to Twitter regarding the Twitter
    Service in the course of your participation in the Buy Now Program
    (collectively "**Feedback**").  You hereby grant Twitter an
    exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up,
    worldwide right and license to copy, modify, create derivative works
    from, publicly display, disclose, distribute, license and
    sublicense, incorporate and otherwise use the Feedback (including
    all intellectual property rights therein), for any and all
    commercial and non-commercial purposes with no obligation of any
    kind to Merchant. Twitter will exclusively own all derivative works,
    and all rights therein, created from such Feedback.

7.  **REVENUE SHARE**. Twitter does not currently charge you any fees
    for your use of the Buy Now Program (although Twitter may charge you
    fees in connection with other Twitter products and services), but
    Twitter may introduce such fees in the future in its
    sole discretion. If Twitter introduces such fees, you will pay such
    fees and otherwise comply with the terms and conditions applicable
    to such fees and you acknowledge and agree that your continued use
    of the Buy Now Program constitutes your acceptance of such fees and
    all related terms and conditions.

8.  **CONFIDENTIALITY**. Each party agrees that all business, technical
    and financial information that is designated as "Confidential" or
    "Proprietary," or is disclosed in a manner such that a reasonable
    person would understand the confidentiality of the information
    disclosed, is the confidential property of the disclosing party and
    its licensors ("**Confidential Information**"). Without limiting the
    generality of the foregoing, the terms of this Agreement are
    Confidential Information of Twitter. Except as expressly allowed
    herein, the receiving party will hold in confidence all Confidential
    Information of the disclosing party and will: (a) disclose the
    Confidential Information of the disclosing party only to those of
    its employees, contractors, agents and advisors who have a need to
    know such Confidential Information for the purposes of this
    Agreement and who have entered into a written confidentiality
    agreement (or are otherwise bound by confidentiality obligations) at
    least as protective as the terms of this Agreement; and (b) use the
    Confidential Information of the other party only for the purpose of
    performing its obligations and exercising its rights under
    this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the receiving party
    shall not be obligated under this Section 7 with respect to
    information that the receiving party can document through writing or
    testimony: (v) is or has become readily publicly available through
    no fault of the receiving party or its employees or agents; (w) is

    information and, to the receiving party’s knowledge, is not subject
    to any disclosure restrictions with respect to such information;
    (x) is disclosed to a third party by the disclosing party without
    restriction on disclosure; (y) was rightfully in the possession of
    the receiving party without restriction prior to its disclosure by
    the disclosing party; or (z) was independently developed by
    employees or consultants of the receiving party without reliance on
    such Confidential Information. The receiving party may make
    disclosures required by law or court order provided the receiving
    party notifies the disclosing party of the issuance of such order
    and allows the disclosing party to participate in the proceeding.

9.  <span id="h.gjdgxs" class="anchor"></span>**TERM.** This Agreement
    is effective as of the earlier of (a) the date you click a button
    indicating your acceptance of the Agreement, and (b) the date you
    begin using the Buy Now Program. At any time, for any or no reason,
    either party may terminate the Agreement by providing written notice
    to the other party. At any time and at Twitter’s sole discretion,
    Twitter may update or modify the Buy Now Program features or
    functionality, or this Agreement, and your continued participation
    in the Buy Now Program will constitute your acceptance of such
    updates and/or modifications.

10. **TERMINATION.** Twitter may terminate this Agreement for
    convenience at any time immediately by giving you written notice
    during the Term. You may terminate this Agreement for convenience at
    any time by giving Twitter ninety (90) days prior written notice
    during the Term. Either party may terminate this Agreement
    immediately upon written notice to the other party if the other
    party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure that

    this Agreement: (a) each party will destroy all Confidential
    Information provided by the other party; and (b) you will destroy
    all Twitter Materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party
    will be required to return, destroy or certify as to the destruction
    of the other party's Confidential Information or other materials to
    the extent that the Confidential Information is embedded in
    electronic data files or is otherwise not reasonably separable for
    return or destruction; however, the other party’s Confidential
    Information (and all copies thereof) will be, if technically
    possible, rendered such that it can no longer be used by such party.

**Twitter Commerce Policy**

Twitter may update this policy from time to time for any reason.

The following policy applies to the Twitter Buy Now Program and the
Product Pages Program . Three separate policies comprise the Twitter
Commerce Policy: (1) the Product Policy, which covers the merchandise or
products a merchant is permitted to offer for sale through the Buy Now
Program and/or the Product Pages Program (e.g. t-shirts, stickers, CDs,
etc.);  (2) the Text and Image Policy, which covers the supporting text
and images posted on the Twitter Service to describe and market
merchandise or products sold through the Buy Now Program and/or the
Product Pages Program; and (3) the Merchant Fraud and Dispute Policy,
which covers a merchant’s responsibility in the event of fraudulent
transactions and merchant disputes.

Products, card text and images used in or offered for sale through use
of Promoted Tweets are be subject to the [Twitter Ads
Policies](https://twitter.com/adspolicy) instead of the Twitter Commerce
Policy; provided, however, that if a product, card text or image is
permitted under the Twitter Ads Policies (either explicitly or
implicitly by omission) but is restricted under the Twitter Commerce
Policy, the restriction in the Twitter Commerce Policy will continue to
apply.

If a product, card text, or image violates the Twitter Commerce Policy
or, if applicable, the Twitter Ads Policies, Twitter may take
appropriate action including but not limited to removal of the
applicable Tweet and/or removal of the merchant’s access to the Buy Now
Program and/or the Product Pages Program.

Twitter’s [general rules](https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311)
and[ Terms of Service](https://twitter.com/tos) also are applicable to
use of the Twitter Service in connection with the Buy Now and Product
Pages Programs and will be enforced.  

Merchants must comply with all applicable laws and regulations including
laws and regulations with regards to promoting and/or selling adult
oriented content or products to minors.

*Fraud and Disputes Policy*
===========================

The below policy covers Merchant responsibility in the event of
fraudulent transactions and customer disputes:

## Fraudulent Transactions ##

Twitter will occasionally reject orders when it has reason to suspect unauthorized or fraudulent transactions. However, it is ultimately the merchant’s responsibility to review all transactions for fraud and to verify suspicious orders. At the minimum, the merchant should investigate instances of: AVS or CVV failures, multiple orders with the same shipping address but different emails or billing zip codes, billing and shipping zip code mismatch, and orders with high dollar amounts.

## Disputes ##

Twitter will communicate to its users that the Twitter Buy Now program only facilitates orders between the customer and the merchant, and all disputes should be directed to the merchant. In the case of a customer dispute, the merchant is responsible for responding in a timely and effective manner. Failure to resolve disputes or an excessive amount of disputes may result in termination from the program.
