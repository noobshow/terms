These Alipay Terms of Services apply if you elect to offer the Alipay software system and service for the making and collection of payments for products and services ("Alipay Services") to your Customers. The Alipay Services are made available to you by Alipay.com Co., Ltd. ("Alipay"), and include the Alipay Wallet, and in these Alipay Terms of Services your Customers that use the Alipay Services are referred to as "Alipay Users".

### 1. Use of Alipay Services.

If you offer the Alipay Services to your Customers, you may not require a minimum or maximum purchase amount with respect to the Customers' use of the Alipay Services.

### 2. Products and Services.

You acknowledge that Alipay may not provide Alipay Services with respect to any transaction which is prohibited by applicable Laws or violates Alipay's internal policies, or which will result in Alipay being considered to have breached any applicable Laws. Accordingly, you must not sell products or services through the Alipay Services that contain articles prohibited or restricted from being sold to Alipay Users under any applicable Laws, including, without limitation, the products and services prohibited by Alipay. Please [contact us](https://stripe.com/contact) for more information about products and services prohibited by Alipay. 

You must provide Stripe with information about your products and services as may be reasonably requested by Stripe or Alipay from time to time, and you must ensure that no transaction submitted through the Alipay Services is for the purchase of any item prohibited by Alipay or Stripe. Alipay and Stripe will have the right to refuse to provide the Alipay Services with respect to any such transaction. To the best of your knowledge, the products or services that you sell do not infringe upon any third party's rights and interests, including, without limitation, intellectual property rights and proprietary rights.  If you become aware that any of your products or services infringes upon any third party's rights and interests, you must notify Stripe and immediately cease selling such products or services.  If you continue to sell infringing goods or services, Stripe may immediately terminate provision of the Alipay Services to you.

### 3. Alipay intellectual property; brand and logo; publicity.

Alipay owns all rights in and to the Alipay Services, including, without limitation, the information described on the [Alipay website](https://alipay.com). Except as expressly stated to the contrary, nothing in these Alipay Terms of Service grants, or may be construed to grant, to you any license, ownership or other rights of any kind in any Alipay content, technology or intellectual property.

You must display the brand or logo of Alipay during checkout for the sale of products or services in parity with other payment methods. You may not use Alipay's logo or proprietary content for any purpose other than to indicate your acceptance of Alipay as a form of payment, unless otherwise authorized by Alipay. You must present a truthful description of the Alipay Services in accordance with Alipay's guidance, and direct Alipay Users to access the Alipay Services using their Alipay Wallet to make the relevant payments.

You may not issue any press release or make any public announcement pertaining to Alipay or the Alipay Services without the prior written consent of Alipay.


### 4. Business purposes.

You may only use the Alipay Services for your own account and with respect to the products and/or services that you have told Stripe about. 

### 5. Modification of Alipay Services.

Alipay may modify the Alipay Services from time to time and require you to take steps to reduce the risk of unauthorized Transactions.

### 6. Alipay User complaints; disputes.

You are solely liable for any complaints by Alipay Users regarding your products and/or services. In the event that Alipay or Stripe becomes aware of complaints by an Alipay User, you will work in good faith to resolve such complaint.

If an Alipay User refuses to pay for a product or service on the basis that there has been an unauthorized Transaction, you must provide documentary evidence, as requested by Alipay and Stripe, that you have properly delivered the products or provided the services in accordance with such underlying transaction order. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to logistics certificates, shipping certificates, receipts, addresses, name and contact information of the recipient; as well as product names and prices. Based upon the provided evidence, Stripe and Alipay will determine whether you have sufficiently demonstrated that you properly delivered the products or provided the services.

### 7. AML requirements.

Alipay is subject to anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism and sanctions ("AML") laws and regulations. In accordance with its AML and anti-fraud practices, Alipay may reject or suspend suspicious transactions and payments, restrict individuals involved in suspicious transactions from using the Alipay Services, and impose other reasonable limitations and controls on your and Alipay Users' use of the Alipay Service sufficient to meet Alipay's AML compliance obligations. Alipay may, for the purposes of complying with applicable suspicious transaction reporting and tipping-off laws and regulations, notify suspicious transactions to the relevant authorities with jurisdiction over Alipay or relevant affiliates of Alipay. 

Within a reasonable time after request from Alipay or Stripe, and only to the extent permitted by applicable Law, you must, at your own cost, provide information and transaction records to permit Alipay to investigate an actual or suspected violation by an Alipay User of the AML laws and regulations applicable to Alipay; except that the information provided shall be limited only to the information required to complete Alipay's investigation.
