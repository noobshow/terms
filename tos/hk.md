## About our Services Agreement

Welcome to Stripe. We developed this payment service (the "Stripe Service" or "Service") to make it easy for you to accept credit and debit card payments online from your customers so you can focus on your own product or service.

We have tried to draft this Services Agreement in a clear and simple manner. Unfortunately, the realities of the legal world make it a very difficult task. So, should you have any questions or concerns or would simply like to better understand how we do things at Stripe, please do not hesitate to [contact us](https://stripe.com/contact).

Below is a quick description of the main sections of this Agreement, but there are important details in the whole document so you should read it.

## The Stripe Service

We provide you with software and a service to process your online credit and debit card payments; we will respect and protect your privacy, data and personal information. You run your business, service your customers, protect your customers' data, report &amp; pay taxes, and observe all laws, rules, and regulations. <a href="#section_a" class="arrow">Complete details</a>

## Registering for Stripe

You provide us with basic information about your organization; we will seek to verify your information (we may work with third parties to do so) and approve your service account unless deemed risky (by us or our payment processors). You give us permission to do all this, and to periodically update the information; otherwise we must decline to offer you the Service. <a href="#section_b" class="arrow">Complete details</a>

## Receiving your Funds from Card Transactions

We pay you for your transactions (minus our Fees), at a schedule communicated to you once your service account is approved. A certain amount of your funds may be subject to an additional hold period (e.g. a Reserve Account) with terms determined by your perceived risk and transaction history. You are responsible for refunds, returns, and liable for customer disputes (chargebacks). <a href="#section_c" class="arrow">Complete details</a>

## Termination and Other Legal Terms

We can terminate this Agreement for any reason or at any time (especially if you are in breach of this Agreement or are breaking the law). You can terminate at any time effective immediately. Termination does not alter your liability for processed payments or related chargebacks. This section also includes all the extra legal stuff they make us add (e.g. indemnification, warranties, assignment). <a href="#section_d" class="arrow">Complete details</a>

You agree to comply with all applicable laws and rules in connection with your collection, use, retention, security and dissemination of any personal, financial, Card, or transaction information (defined as "Payment Data") on your website, through your app or otherwise in your possession. While Stripe helps to make compliance easier, you are solely responsible for compliance with any laws, regulations, or rules applicable to your business. You agree that at all times you will be compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) and the Payment Application Data Security Standards (PA-DSS), as applicable. The steps you will need to take to comply with PCI-DSS and PA-DSS when using Stripe will vary based on your implementation. For more information about implementing Stripe, please refer to our <a href="https://stripe.com/docs">Documentation</a>. If we believe it is necessary based on your implementation and request it of you, you will promptly provide us with documentation evidencing your compliance with PCI-DSS and/or PA-DSS if requested by Stripe. You also agree that you will use only PCI compliant service providers in connection with the storage, or transmission, of Payment Data, which includes a Cardholder's account number, expiration date, and CVV2. You must not store CVV2 data at any time. Information on the PCI-DSS can be found on the PCI Council's website. It is your responsibility to comply with these standards.

### 8. Security and Fraud Controls

Stripe is responsible for protecting the security of Payment Data in our possession and will maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical procedures to protect all the personal information regarding you and your customers that is stored in our servers from unauthorised access and accidental loss or modification. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use such personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide this personal information regarding you and your customers at your own risk. We recommend you review our <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which will help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us.

Stripe may provide or suggest security procedures and controls intended to reduce the risk to you of fraud ("Security Controls"). These Security Controls may include processes or applications that are developed by Stripe or by third parties, including but not limited to providing two-factor authentication for logging into your Stripe Account. You agree to review all Security Controls and choose those that are appropriate for your business to protect against unauthorised transactions and, if necessary, use other procedures and controls not provided by us. Disabling or failing to properly use Security Controls increases your exposure to unauthorised Card transactions. Keep in mind that you are responsible for the use of lost or stolen data that is used to purchase products or services from your business. We are not liable for and do not insure against losses to you or your customers resulting from use of lost or stolen data with the Stripe Services (including but not limited to losses arising from the use of lost or stolen credit cards to make purchases from your site or app, or those caused by a compromise of your login credentials).

### 9. Audit Right

If we believe that a security breach or compromise of data has occurred, we may require you to have a third party auditor that is approved by us conduct a security audit of your systems and facilities and issue a report to be provided to Stripe, the Designated Bank, Earthport and/or the Card Networks and you shall be required to remedy any defects identified within a reasonable period or a timeframe given by the Card Network.

### 10. Privacy and Data Protection

<strong>a. Privacy:</strong> You acknowledge that you have received, read in full and agree with the terms of our <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> linked to and incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Our <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> contains your consent to our collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personal information as well as other matters set forth therein and which explains how and for what purposes we collect, use, retain, disclose, and safeguard the information you provide to us.

<strong>b. Data Protection:</strong> Protection of personal data is very important to us. Stripe will at all times comply with the provisions of applicable data protection law. If Stripe processes any personal data on your behalf when performing its obligations under this Agreement, Stripe and you both agree that it is intended that you shall be the data user and we shall be the data processor in relation to that data. We shall process the personal data only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and any lawful instructions reasonably given by you to us from time to time and not for any other purpose. This will include having appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data that is processed. As data processor, Stripe is entitled to appoint sub-processors for parts of its processing of personal data, provided however, that the sub-processor assumes the same obligations as are imposed on Stripe as data processor.
You acknowledge that Stripe is reliant on you for direction as to the extent to which we are entitled to use and process the personal data you provide us with. Consequently, we will not be liable for any claim brought by a data subject arising from any action or omission by us, to the extent that such action or omission resulted from your instructions.

<strong>c. Data Requests:</strong> We will notify you (within a reasonable time frame) if we receive a request from a person to have access to that person's personal data, a complaint or request relating to your obligations under applicable data protection legislation, or any other communication relating directly to the processing of any personal data in connection with this Agreement.
Stripe will provide you with reasonable co-operation and assistance in relation to any complaint or request made in respect of any personal data processed by us on your behalf, including by providing you with details of the complaint or request, complying with any data subject access, rectification or deletion requests (within the relevant timescales set out in applicable data protection legislation) and providing you with any personal data we hold in relation to a person making a complaint or request (again, within a reasonable timescale).

Card Network Reporting:</strong> You acknowledge that we are required to report your business name and the name of your principals to the Match™ listing maintained by MasterCard and accessed and updated by American Express, VMAS database upheld by Visa or to the Consortium Merchant Negative File maintained by Discover, if applicable, pursuant to the requirements of the Network Rules (as defined in Section A(14) below). During the course of this Agreement we reserve the right to place any terminated merchant in a terminated merchant file established by the Card Networks for termination with due cause. You specifically consent to our compliance with the obligations related to the listing by us and to the listing itself and you waive and hold harmless Stripe from all claims and liabilities you may have as a result of such reporting.

### 11. Your Privacy Obligations

You represent to Stripe that you are in compliance with all applicable privacy laws, you have obtained all necessary rights and consents under applicable law to disclose to Stripe, or allow Stripe to collect, use, retain and disclose any Cardholder data that you provide to Stripe or authorize Stripe to collect, including information that we may collect directly from your end users via cookies or other means, and that Stripe will not be in breach of any such laws by collecting, receiving, using and disclosing such information in connection with the Service. As between you and Stripe, you are solely responsible for disclosing to your customers that Stripe is processing credit card transactions for you and obtaining Data from such customers. Stripe will provide some or all of the Service from systems located within the United States or other countries outside of Hong Kong. It is your obligation to disclose to your customers that Cardholder data may be transferred, processed and stored outside of Hong Kong and, as set forth in our Privacy Policy, may be subject to disclosure as required by applicable law.

If you receive information about others, including Cardholders, through the use of the Service, you must keep such information confidential and only use it in connection with the Service. You may not disclose or distribute any such information to a third party or use any such information for marketing purposes unless you receive the express consent of the user to do so. You may not disclose card numbers to any third party, other than in connection with processing a card transaction requested by your customers under the Service.

Stripe Connect allows third-party platform providers ("Platforms") to help you administer your Stripe Account and provide additional services directly to you or your customers. To permit Platforms to connect to your Stripe Account, you must add the Platform through the Stripe management dashboard and accept the <a href="https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal">Stripe Connected Account Agreement</a> ("Stripe Connected Account Agreement").

By connecting Platforms to your Stripe Account you are authorizing Stripe to permit these Platforms to (a) access your Stripe Account and Payment Data, (b) create charges and customers in your Stripe Account, and (c) deduct amounts (for example, fees and charges) from the amount that would otherwise be payable to you from transactions occurring in connection with the Platform ("Platform Fees"). Any Platform Fees will be separately agreed upon by you and the Platform, and will be in addition to Stripe's fees and charges.

Once you have authorised a Platform it will continue to have access to your Stripe Account and be authorised as described in Stripe Connected Account Agreement until you specifically withdraw your authorization by changing the settings through your Stripe management dashboard.

### 18. Stripe Relay

Stripe Relay allows you to publish information that describes specific products or services and their variations, including but not limited to descriptions, SKUs, prices, inventory, and images ("Product Data") to various online, mobile, off-site online or affiliate channels (each a "Channel"); allows customers to make purchases of such products through such Channels (each an "Order"); and permits you to manage inventory and order information for such purchases. As used in this section, "Order Data" means the information transmitted using your systems, or systems you control, for the purpose of initiating or completing a transaction (including portions of the Payment Data).

Any Product Data you provide to us will be provided to the Channels you select through the Stripe management dashboard. You understand and agree that Channels will publish Product Data as you have provided it through Stripe Relay. You are solely responsible for acquiring the appropriate rights to publish Product Information through the Channels, and for any pricing, inventory information, facts or statements &mdash; even those made erroneously &mdash; that are contained in the Product Data. You grant to Stripe a worldwide, fully-paid, nontransferable licence to: (a) publish Product Data through the Channels, (b) receive and transmit Order Data to you, and (c) use any trademarks, service marks, or non-public personal information contained in Product Data or Orders data therein to the extent required to perform either (a) or (b); and authorize Stripe to sublicence such rights to Channels.

You represent and warrant that you will not falsely advertise any Product Data through Channels, and that you will not use any unfair or deceptive acts or practices when advertising the underlying product or service through the Channels. You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for production, fulfillment, shipping, or providing any ancillary services related to Orders you receive through your use of Stripe Relay.

### 19. Additional Services

From time to time we may offer you additional features or services ("Additional Services"), such as <a href="https://stripe.com/checkout/info">Stripe Checkout</a> or international services, which may be subject to additional or different terms of service. As with the Stripe Services, you may not use these Additional Services unless you agree to the applicable terms of service. Except where expressly stated otherwise, your use of Additional Services will have no impact on the applicability of this Agreement to the Service.

<h2 id="section_b">Section B: Registering for Stripe</h2>

### 1. Registration

The Stripe Service is only made available to persons or entities in Hong Kong that operate a business selling goods and services, and the Stripe Service is not made available to persons to accept card payments for personal, family or household purposes. To use Stripe for your business, you will first have to register for Stripe. When you register for Stripe, we will collect basic information including your name, business name (where applicable), location, email address, business identification number and phone number. If you have not already done so, you will also be required to provide an email address and password to access Stripe (your "Stripe Account credentials").

These two fields may appear in your customers' credit or debit card statements. To avoid customer confusion and transaction disputes, it is important that you enter a description that clearly identifies your business as well as an accurate site URL. You agree to indemnify Stripe from any costs from disputes due to customers failing to recognize your business name on their statements.

### 3. Verification and Underwriting

To verify your identity, we will require additional information including without limitation your company registration number, your VAT number and, if applicable, your date of birth, and such other information or records as may be required for us or the Designated Bank or Earthport to comply with any contractual or compliance obligations (including obligations to comply with obligations relating to anti money laundering, know your customer and sanctions screening) as may be determined to be applicable by us in our absolute discretion. We may also ask for additional information to help verify your identity and assess your business risk including business invoices, a driver's license or other government issued identification, or a business license. We may ask you for financial statements. We may request for your permission to do a physical inspection at your place of business and to examine books and records that pertain to your compliance with this Agreement. Your failure to comply with any of these requests within five (5) days may result in suspension or termination of your Stripe Account. You authorize us to retrieve additional information about you from third parties and other identification services. Stripe may use your information to apply for card merchant acquiring accounts on your behalf with certain Card Networks (such as American Express).

After we have collected and verified all your information, Stripe will review it and determine if you are eligible to use the Service. Stripe may also share your information with the Designated Bank and Earthport, each of which may also make a determination regarding your eligibility. We will notify you once your account has been either approved or deemed ineligible for use of the Service.

<strong>By accepting the terms of this Agreement, you are providing us with authorization to retrieve information about you from and provide information about you to third parties, including but not limited to credit reporting agencies or bureaus and other information providers and you authorize and direct such third parties to compile and provide such information to us. You acknowledge that such information retrieved and provided may include your name, address history, credit history, and other data about you.</strong> Stripe may periodically update this information to determine whether you continue to meet our eligibility requirements.

You agree that Stripe is permitted to contact and share information about you and your application (including whether you are approved or declined), and your Stripe Account with the Designated Bank and Earthport. This includes sharing information (a) about your transactions for regulatory or compliance purposes, (b) for use in connection with the management and maintenance of the Service, (c) to create and update their customer records about you and to assist them in better serving you, and (d) to conduct Stripe's risk management process.

By accepting this Agreement you confirm that you satisfy these requirements and will continue to do so in connection with your use of the Service.
The Service is controlled and operated from Stripe's facilities in the United States. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States, foreign and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations.

### 5. Prohibited Businesses

There are certain categories of businesses and business practices for which the Stripe Service cannot be used ("Prohibited Businesses"). Many of these Prohibited Business categories are imposed by Card Network Rules or the requirements of our banking providers, the Designated Bank or Earthport. We maintain a list here: Prohibited Businesses. By registering for a Stripe Account, you confirm that you will not use the Stripe Services to accept payments in connection with any of the <a href="https://stripe.com/prohibited_businesses">Prohibited Businesses</a>. If you are uncertain as to whether a business is a Prohibited Business, or have questions about how these requirements apply to your business, please contact us.

### 6. Business Conduct

You will only accept payments through Stripe for transactions between you and your customers for the bona fide sale of lawful goods or services. You will not solicit or use Payment Data for any purpose other than to process payment for your goods and services. You will comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of governments having jurisdiction in connection with your use of the Service.

<h2 id="section_c">Section C: Processing Card Transactions and Receiving Your Funds</h2>

### 1. Processing Card Transactions

You agree that you will accept all eligible cards presented for payment by your customers for your goods and services in accordance with the Network Rules, this Agreement and any operating guides that we may provide you from time to time. You agree that you will obtain an authorization from the Card Network(s) for each card transaction, as required under the Network Rules, and will not submit a card transaction for settlement where there is a negative authorization or the card is otherwise expired. You acknowledge that the existence of an affirmative authorization from Stripe or the Card Networks does not mean that a particular card transaction will not be subject to Chargeback, Reversal or Claim (each such term as defined in Section D(6) below) at a later date.

You will not impose an excessive fee or surcharge on a customer that seeks to use an eligible payment card. If you impose a fee or surcharge it must be limited to reflect your costs for the use of such payment card. If you levy an additional charge or offer a reduction in cost to your customers for using a particular eligible payment card this information must be advised to your customers before the start of the payment transaction. You will provide a receipt to your customers at the conclusion of the purchase transaction that includes all information required under Network Rules and applicable law.

You will submit all card transactions for processing no later than three (3) days from the date of authorization. You will maintain appropriate records of all card transactions for a period of at least five (5) years from the date of the transaction.

You will display all Card Network marks in accordance with the applicable Card Network Rules, and will use such marks only to indicate that you accept their cards for payment.

### 2. Payouts and Transaction History; Multi-Currency Processing
Settlement funds received from the Card Networks will be directed by Earthport to your specified bank account ("Bank Account") in the amounts actually received (less our Fees and certain other amounts as defined below) for card transactions submitted to our Service. The payouts will be made to the Bank Account you provide for in your Stripe Account. The Bank Account must be an account located at a bank in Hong Kong and held in your business name. You are responsible for the accuracy and correctness of information you supply regarding your Bank Account. Funds for any given transaction will not be transferred to your Bank Account until the transaction is deemed complete. Transactions will be deemed complete when the Designated Bank has received funds settling from the relevant Card Network and has transferred such funds to the settlement account. The actual timing of the transfers to your Bank Account of the settlement funds will be subject to the Payout Schedule as defined below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that all credits for funds provided to you are provisional and subject to reversal including without limitation if there are adjustments for inaccuracies and errors (including rejects) and Chargebacks, Reversals or Claims in accordance with this Agreement and the Card Network Rules payment rules, whether or not a transaction is charged back by the issuer of the Card or the Cardholder. Accordingly, you authorize us to initiate reversal or adjustment (debit or credit) entries to the Bank Account and to initiate or suspend such entries in accordance with this Agreement as may be necessary to grant or reverse fund payouts for any transaction.

After each payout of card settlement funds to your Bank Account, we will update information in your Stripe management dashboard to reflect settlement. For all Visa and MasterCard Transactions, this information will include, on a monthly basis, the Transaction ID, Transaction amount in your settlement currency, and relevant charges, including the interchange fee and other merchant service charges. Information regarding your card transactions processed and settled with the Service ("Transaction History") will be available to you when you login to our website using your Stripe Account credentials. We provide a minimum of one year of Transaction History on our website. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Transaction History and your use of the Service.

We may offer you the ability to have funds settled to your Bank Account in a currency different from the one in which you accepted payment from your customers ("Multi-Currency Processing"). To use this service, you must provide us with a valid Bank Account for each currency for which you request settlement, based on our list of available settlement currencies. We may add or remove currencies from our list of available settlement currencies at any time. If you use Multi-Currency Processing, we will identify at the time of charge (for example, through our API response), the conversion rate that will apply to the charge. If you refund a charge, the conversion rate that will apply will be the rate in effect at the time of the refund, not the charge. By submitting a charge or refund for processing you will be deemed to have accepted the rate. You may choose not to use the Multi-Currency Processing service at any time. You may also change the Bank Account information or other settings associated with your use of Multi-Currency Processing, but any such changes will only affect subsequent charges.

### 3. Payout Schedule

Payout schedule refers to the time it takes to initiate a transfer to your Bank Account of settlement funds arising from card transactions processed through the Service ("Payout Schedule"). Once your Bank Account information has been verified, a transfer of settlement funds (net of Fees, Chargebacks, Reversals, Claims and other funds owed to us for any reason) will be initiated by Earthport in accordance with the Payout Schedule, the terms of which will be made available to you when you login to our website using your Stripe Account credentials. The settlement funds shall be credited to your Bank Account by the end of the business day following the last day of the Payout Schedule. We are not responsible for any action taken by the institution holding your Bank Account that may result in some or all of the funds not being credited to your Bank Account or not being made available to you in your Bank Account. You can contact Stripe to inquire about changing the timing of your Payout Schedule. Upon submitting a request, you will be informed of the process and requirements for Stripe to review your Payout Schedule.

Stripe reserves the right to change the Payout Schedule or suspend payouts to your Bank Account should we determine it is necessary due to pending disputes, excessive or anticipated excessive Chargebacks or refunds, or other suspicious activity associated with your use of the Service or if required by Card Networks, law or court order. If we do this we will notify you by email as soon as possible and include the reasons for doing so unless it is unlawful for us to so notify you.

Your opening of a Stripe Account and thereby agreeing to be bound by this Agreement and the Payout Schedule shall be deemed as your consent to the execution of the necessary payment orders to transfer settlement funds to your Bank Account in accordance with this Agreement and such payment orders are deemed received on the day agreed for the execution of such payment orders in accordance with this Agreement and the Payout Schedule.

### 4. Reconciliations and Errors
Your Transaction History will be available to you when you login to your Stripe Account on our website. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for reconciling your Transaction History with your actual card payment transactions. You agree to notify Stripe using Stripe's contact details set out above of any discrepancies arising from such reconciliation and verification without undue delay and no later than 6 months after the date of the transaction. We will investigate any reported discrepancies and attempt to rectify any errors that you or we discover. If Stripe has failed to transmit the payment order in accordance with Section C(1), Stripe will immediately re-transmit the payment order. In the event you are owed money as a result of the discrepancy, Stripe will transfer funds to your Bank Account in the next scheduled payout. Your failure to notify us of an error or discrepancy in your Transaction History within sixty (60) days of when it first appears on your Transaction History will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you in connection with any such error or discrepancy in processing your card payments.

If you submit or cause us to process transactions erroneously, you agree to contact us immediately. We will investigate any reported errors and attempt to rectify any errors that you or we discover by crediting or debiting your Bank Account as appropriate. Stripe will only attempt to correct transactions that you process incorrectly if and when you notify us of such an error. Your failure to notify us of such a processing error within thirty (30) days of when it first appears on your Transaction History will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.

### 5. Refunds and Returns

By accepting this Services Agreement, you agree to submit any and all refunds and adjustments for returns of your products and services through the Stripe Service to the Cardholder's card in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Network Rules. Network Rules require that you will (i) maintain a fair return, cancellation or adjustment policy; (ii) disclose your return or cancellation policy to customers at the time of purchase, (iii) not give cash refunds to customers in connection with a Card sale, unless required by law, and (iv) not accept cash or any other item of value for preparing a Card sale refund.

Full refunds must be for the exact amount of the original transaction including tax, handling charges, and other. The refund amount may not exceed the original sale amount except by an amount equal to any reimbursements to customers for postage costs incurred for product returns. Refunds processed through the Stripe Service must be submitted within sixty (60) days of the original transaction but in all cases, within three (3) days of approving the Cardholder refund.

For processed refunds, Stripe will deduct the refund amount (including any applicable Fees) from (i) settlement funds owed to you from processing of other card transactions, or (ii) funds in any Reserve Account (as defined below). If these funds are not sufficient, you authorize Stripe to forward a debit entry issued by you in the amount necessary to complete the refund transaction to the Cardholder's card to each of the banks maintaining the Bank Account and the Settlement Account. In the event Stripe cannot access your Bank Account by means of a direct debit, you agree to pay all funds owed to Stripe upon demand. You are solely responsible for accepting and processing returns of your products and services; Stripe has no responsibility or obligation for processing such returns.

### 6. Chargebacks

A Chargeback (defined below in Section D(6)) is typically caused when a customer disputes a charge that appears on their statement. A Chargeback may result in the reversal of a transaction, with the amount charged back to you. You can be assessed Chargebacks for: (i) customer disputes, (ii) unauthorized or improperly authorized transactions, (iii) transactions that do not comply with Network Rules or the terms of this Agreement or are allegedly unlawful or suspicious, or (iv) any reversals for any reason by the Card Network, the Designated Bank or Earthport, or the Cardholder's card issuing financial institution.

When a Chargeback is issued, you are immediately liable to Stripe for the full amount of payment of the Chargeback plus any associated Fees, fines, expenses or penalties (including those assessed by the Card Networks, the Designated Bank or Earthport). You authorize and agree that Stripe may recover these amounts by debiting your Bank Account associated with your Stripe Account by direct debit, debiting your Reserve Account, or setting off any amounts owed to you by us. If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you will pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon our demand. You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including without limitation legal fees and other legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of us in connection with the collection of any unpaid Chargebacks unpaid by you.

Further, if we reasonably believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you under this Agreement until such time that: (a) a Chargeback is assessed due to a customer's complaint, in which case we will retain the funds; (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the customer may dispute that the transaction has expired; or (c) we determine that a Chargeback on the transaction will not occur.

### 7. Contesting your Chargebacks

You or Stripe may elect to contest Chargebacks assessed to your Bank Account. Stripe may provide you with assistance including notifications and software to help contest your Chargebacks. We do not assume any liability for our role or assistance in contesting Chargebacks.

You agree to provide us with the necessary information, in a timely manner and at your expense, to investigate or help resolve any Chargeback. You also grant us permission to share records or other information required with the Cardholder, the Cardholder's card issuing financial institution, and the financial institution where you have your Bank Account to help resolve any disputes. You acknowledge that your failure to provide us with complete and accurate information in a timely manner may result in an irreversible Chargeback being assessed.

If the Cardholder's issuing financial institution or the relevant Card Network does not resolve a dispute in your favor, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees from you as described in this Agreement.

We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating or investigating Chargeback disputes.

### 8. Excessive Chargebacks

At any point, Stripe, the Designated Bank, Earthport or the Card Networks may determine that you are incurring excessive Chargebacks. Excessive Chargebacks may result in additional fees, penalties, or fines. Excessive Chargebacks may also result in additional controls and restrictions to your use of the Stripe Service, including without limitation, (i) changes to the terms of your Reserve Account, (ii) increases to your applicable Fees, (iii) delays in your Payout Schedule, or (iv) possible suspension or termination of your Stripe Account and the Service. The Card Networks may also place additional controls or restrictions as part of their own monitoring programs for merchants with excessive Chargebacks.

### 9. Stripe Fees

You agree to pay the fees assessed by us to you for providing the processing and other services described in this Agreement ("Fees"). These Fees will be calculated pursuant to the <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing">Fee Schedule</a> linked to and incorporated into this Agreement by reference. We reserve the right to revise our Fees at any time, subject to a two (2) months' notice period to you. You are also obligated to pay all taxes and other charges imposed by any governmental authority, including without limitation any goods or services tax (including VAT), on the Service provided under this Agreement. If you are tax-exempt, you will provide us with an appropriate certificate or other evidence of tax exemption that is satisfactory to us.

You acknowledge that you are also responsible for any penalties or fines imposed on Stripe or directly to you by any Card Network or financial institution as a result of your activities.

### 10. Our Collection Rights

To the extent permitted by law, we may collect any obligations you owe us under this Agreement by deducting the corresponding amounts from the Reserve Account or from funds payable to you arising from the settlement of card transactions. Fees will be assessed at the time a transaction is processed and will be first deducted from the funds received for such transactions. If the settlement amounts or Reserve Account are not sufficient to meet your obligations to us, we may charge or debit the Bank Account registered in your Stripe Account for any amounts owed to us. Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand will be a material breach of this Agreement. You will be liable for our costs associated with collection in addition to the amount owed, including without limitation legal fees and expenses, costs of any arbitration or court proceeding, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.

Additionally, we may require a personal guarantee from a principal of a business for funds owed under this Agreement. If we require a personal guarantee we will specifically inform you.

### 11. Reserves

Funds held in reserves are amounts of money set aside by Stripe in an account maintained by it to cover Chargebacks, refunds, or other payment obligations under this Agreement (a "Reserve Account"). Stripe, in its sole discretion, will set the terms of the Reserve Account and notify you of such terms, which may require that a certain amount (including the full amount) of the funds received for card transactions we process for you is held for a period of time or that additional amounts are held in Reserve Account. Stripe, in its sole discretion, may elect to change the terms of the Reserve Account at any time for any reason based on your payment processing history or as requested by the Designated Bank or Earthport.

Stripe may fund the Reserve Account by means of: (i) any funds payouts made or due to you for card transactions submitted to the Service, or (ii) amounts available in your Bank Account by means of a debit to that Bank Account, or (iv) other sources of funds associated with your Stripe Account; or (iv) requesting that you provide funds to Stripe for deposit to the Reserve Account. You agree you are not entitled to any interest on the funds held in the Reserve Account, that you have no right to direct that account and that you may not assign any interest in those funds or that account.

### 12. Security Interest

You grant Stripe a lien and security interest in the Bank Account and all funds on deposit therein regardless of the source of such funds, any rights you may have in respect of funds on deposit in the Reserve Account regardless of the source of such funds, all Card transactions (including future Card transactions), any rights to receive credits or payments under this Agreement, and all funds, deposits and other property of yours possessed or maintained by us on your behalf. These security interests and liens will secure payment and performance of all of your obligations under this Agreement and any other agreements now existing or later entered into between us and you including without limitation your obligation to pay any amounts due and owing to us. You will execute, deliver, and pay the fees for any documents we request to create, perfect, maintain and enforce this security interest.

### 13. Pre-Authorized Debits

You agree to complete and return the attached direct debit mandate(s) to authorise the Designated Bank and/or Earthport to initiate debit and credit entries to the Bank Account in accordance with this Agreement. You hereby waive the right to receive advance notice from Stripe and/or the Designated Bank of any and all such debits. You agree not to terminate or cancel the direct debit mandate until all of your obligations to us have been paid in full. If you change the Bank Account, you shall promptly provide the Designated Bank with a new direct debit mandate completed in respect of the new account and you shall provide us in writing such other information regarding the new account as we deem necessary. Such new account shall thereafter be and become the "Bank Account" for the purpose of this Agreement. It may take us up to ten (10) business days after receipt of a written notice from you to reflect in our system any change to the Bank Account. If you change the Bank Account, you agree that you are responsible for all costs incurred by us in connection with your decision to change the Bank Account.

Notwithstanding the above provisions, this Agreement may be rescinded or varied in any way and at any time by the parties to this Agreement without the consent of the Third Parties.

### 15. Third Party Services and Links to Other Websites

You may be offered services, products and promotions provided by third parties and not by us. If you decide to use these services, you will be responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions associated with these services. You agree that we are not responsible for the performance of these services. The Stripe website may contain links to third party websites as a convenience to you. The inclusion of any website link does not imply an approval, endorsement, recommendation by us. You agree that you access any such website at your own risk, and that the site is not governed by the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement. We expressly disclaim any liability for these websites. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies.

### 16. Force Majeure

No party will be liable for delays in processing or other nonperformance caused by such events as fires, telecommunications or internet failures, utility failures, power failures, equipment failures, employment strife, riots, war, terrorist attack, nonperformance of our vendors or suppliers, acts of God, or other causes over which the respective party has no reasonable control, except that nothing in this section will affect or excuse your liabilities and obligations under Section D(6), including without limitation for Reversals, Chargebacks, Claims, fines, fees, refunds or unfulfilled products and services.

### 17. Responding to Legal Process

Stripe may respond to and comply with any writ of attachment, lien, levy, subpoena, warrant, or other legal order ("Legal Process") that we believe to be valid. We may deliver or hold any funds or, subject to the terms of our Privacy Policy, any information as required under such Legal Process, even if you are receiving funds on behalf of third parties. Where permitted, we will use reasonable efforts to provide you notice of such Legal Process by sending a copy to the email address we have on file for you. Stripe is not responsible for any losses, whether direct or indirect, that you may incur as a result of our complying with Legal Process.

### 18. Entire Agreement; Remedies

These terms and conditions and all policies and procedures that are incorporated herein by reference constitute the entire agreement between you and Stripe with respect to the provision of the Service. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any other Stripe agreement or policy, this Agreement shall prevail on the subject matter of this Agreement. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, these terms describe the entire liability of Stripe and our vendors and suppliers (including processors) and sets forth your exclusive remedies with respect to the Service and your access and use of the Service. If any provision of this Agreement (or portion thereof) is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it shall be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. This Agreement has been reviewed by you with the benefit of independent legal counsel to the extent you consider necessary and any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not apply to the construction or interpretation of this Agreement. The rights conferred upon us in this Agreement are not intended to be exclusive of each other or of any other rights and remedies we may have at law or in equity. Rather, each and every right we may have under this Agreement, at law or in equity is cumulative and concurrent and in addition to every other right.

### 19. Survival
