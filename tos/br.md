<section>

These Terms and Conditions constitute a legal agreement (“Agreement” or “Merchant Agreement”) between and among the sole proprietor or business entity or business organization listed as the “Merchant” on the Service registration page (sometimes referred to as “you,” “your” or “user”), Stripe Brasil Participações Ltda. (“Stripe”, “we”, “our” or “us”), as agent of Elavon, and Elavon do Brasil Soluções de Pagamento S.A. (“Elavon”), as acquirer. You must read, understand and accept all conditions set forth in this Agreement and other policies incorporated herein by reference before registering as user of the Service (as defined below).

##<a id="section_a"></a> Section A: The Stripe Service

### 1. Object

The object of this Agreement is the rendering of payment platform technology and processing services by Stripe (“Service” or “Stripe Service”) to you. Our Service helps you accept and process credit card, debit card, other types of card payments (collectively “cards” or “Cards”, each a “card” or “Card”) and other payment solutions from your customers (each, a “customer” or a “Cardholder”) in exchange for your products and services. Stripe is not a payment arranger or a payment institution and Stripe does not manage payment accounts, issue electronic currency or acts as an acquirer as defined by Law No. 12.865, dated October 9, 2013 and other applicable rules issued by the National Monetary Council and/or the Brazilian Central Bank. You hereby acknowledge that Stripe does not provide any kind of acquiring services, which will be performed by Elavon under this Agreement and applicable laws and regulations. In addition, Stripe and Elavon do not assume any liability for the products or services purchased using our Service. You will be required to register for a service account to use Stripe (see Section B(1) for further details). This “Stripe account” allows you to review card transactions that are in process of settling from a Card Network (as defined below) and us to your specified settlement bank account.

### 2. Our Software

We provide the Stripe application programming interfaces (collectively, “API”) and other software to enable you to use the Service. We reserve the right to require you to install or update any and all software to continue using the Service. Our Service also includes software to help you manage recurring and subscription billing charges for your products and services. It is your responsibility to obtain your customers’ consent, when billing on a recurring basis, in compliance with applicable legal requirements and, where applicable, rules issued by the applicable credit card networks (“Card Network Rules”, see Section A(14) for further details), and rules issued by Elavon.

### 3. Authorization for Handling of Funds

By accepting this Agreement, you authorize us to hold, receive, and disburse funds on your behalf when such funds from your card transactions settle from the Card Networks. You acknowledge that the funds referred to above will be held in an account held by Stripe with Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. (”Designated Bank”). You further authorize Stripe to instruct the Designated Bank in the way your card transaction settlement funds should be disbursed to you (such as by Transferência Eletrônica Disponível - TED or Documento de Ordem de Crédito – DOC) and the timing of such disbursements. You also agree that Stripe may hold settlement funds in a deposit account at the Designated Bank on your behalf pending disbursement of the funds to you in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. You agree you are not entitled (i) to use the compensation associated with the settlement funds held in the deposit account at the Designated Bank to purchase any product or service or transfer these settlement funds to fulfill any other given obligation that does not necessarily relate to the purchase of product or service; or (ii) to any interest or other compensation associated with the settlement funds held in the deposit account at the Designated Bank pending settlement to the bank settlement account indicated by you when registering for the use of Stripe, that you have no right to direct that deposit account, that you have no legal interest in those funds or that account and that you may not assign any interest in those funds or the deposit account at the Designated Bank. From time to time, we may make available to you information in the Stripe Service regarding anticipated settlement amounts that have been received by us on your behalf from the Card Networks and are being held pending settlement. This settlement information does not constitute a deposit or other obligation of Stripe to you. This settlement information reflected in the Stripe management dashboard is for reporting and informational purposes only, and you are not entitled to, and have no ownership or other rights in settlement funds, until such funds are credited to your specified bank settlement account. Your authorizations set forth herein will remain in full force and effect until your Stripe account is closed or terminated as provided in [Section B](#section_b).  below.

### 4. Payment Methods

Stripe’s card processing service supports any Brazilian-issued card and most international cards with a Card Network logo including credit, debit or other payment instruments. Stripe will only process card transactions that have been authorized by the applicable Card Network or card issuer. You are solely responsible for verifying the identity of users and the eligibility of each presented payment card used to purchase your products and services. Stripe and Elavon do not guarantee or assume any liability for transactions authorized and completed which may later be reversed or charged back (see Chargebacks below). You are solely responsible for all reversed or charged back transactions, regardless of the reason for, or timing of, the reversal or chargeback. Stripe may add or remove one or more types of cards as a supported payment card at any time without prior notice to you.

### 5. Customer Service

Stripe will provide you with customer service to help resolve any issues relating to your use of Stripe, your card payment processing and use of our software, and the distribution of funds to your specified bank settlement account. You, and you alone, are responsible for providing service to your customers for any and all issues related to your products and services, including but not limited to issues arising from the processing of customers’ cards through the Service.

### 6. Taxes

The taxes of any nature related to the transactions provided in this Agreement shall be paid by the party to whom the law ascribes the responsibility.

### 7. Security

Stripe is responsible for protecting the security of Card Data in our possession and will maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect all the Card Data and personal information regarding you and your customers that is stored in our servers from unauthorized access and accidental loss or modification. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use such personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide this personal information regarding you and your customers at your own risk.
You acknowledge and agree that we may, at our sole discretion and at any time, make changes to such administrative, technical and physical procedures in order to improve our security.

### 8. Data Security

You are fully responsible for the security of data on your website or otherwise in your possession. You agree to comply with all applicable municipal, state and federal laws and rules in connection with your collection, use, retention, security and dissemination of any personal, financial, Card, or transaction information (defined as “Data”) on your website. You agree that at all times you shall be compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) and the Payment Application Data Security Standards (PA-DSS), as applicable. The steps you will need to take to comply with PCI-DSS and PA-DSS when using Stripe will vary based on your implementation. For more information about implementing Stripe, please refer to our Documentation. If we believe it is necessary based on your implementation and request it of you, you will promptly provide us with documentation evidencing your compliance with PCI-DSS and/or PA-DSS. If your implementation involves storage or transmission of Card Data you also agree that you will use only PCI compliant service providers in connection with such storage or transmission. In any event, you must not store CVV2 data at any time. Information on the PCI-DSS can be found on the [PCI Council’s website](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org). It is your responsibility to comply with these standards.
You shall also comply with the data security requirements of the Card Networks, Elavon and Stripe.

Your data security obligations under this Section remain valid even after this Agreement is terminated for any reason. Non-compliance with your data security obligations, including through the acts of your officers, employees, agents and subcontractors shall render you liable for any resulting losses, penalties, fines, damages or other remedies incurred by or imposed on Stripe or Elavon.

### 9. Audit Right

If Stripe and Elavon together believe that a security breach or compromise of data has occurred, Stripe and Elavon together may require you to have a third party auditor that is approved by Stripe and Elavon to conduct a security audit of your systems and facilities and issue a report to be provided to Stripe, the Designated Bank, Elavon and the Card Networks.

If you suspect, have reason to suspect or become aware that any breach or compromise of data has occurred, you must notify Stripe and Elavon immediately.

### 10. Privacy

Your privacy and the protection of your data are very important to us. You acknowledge that you have received, read in full and agree with the terms of our Privacy Policy linked to and incorporated into this Agreement by reference, which contains your consent to our collection, use, retention and disclosure of personal information as well as other matters set forth therein and which explains how and for what purposes we collect, use, retain, disclose and safeguard the information you provide to us. Stripe and Elavon shall maintain the confidentiality of your data, except when disclosure, including to the competent authorities, the Ministry of Finance, the Brazilian Central Bank and the Federal or Local Tax Authorities, is required in order to comply with law, and in which case Stripe and Elavon may disclose all information requested regarding you and/or your data.
You also acknowledge that Stripe and/or Elavon are required to report your business name, the name of your principals and principals information to be checked with the Restricted listings required by Card Networks and/or the Brazilian Government, if applicable.

You may not disclose card numbers to any third party, other than in connection with processing a card transaction requested by your customer under the Service, or if required by law.

In the event of any unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including but not limited to Card Data and Cardholder Data, by you including through acts of your officers, employees, agents and subcontractors, you will be responsible for reimbursing Stripe and Elavon for any resulting losses, penalties, fines, damages or other remedies incurred by or imposed on Stripe or Elavon.

Stripe and Elavon reserve the right to share information with law enforcement about you, your transactions, or your use of the Service if Stripe and Elavon reasonably suspect that your Stripe account has been used for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose.
You agree that Stripe and/or Elavon may seek to identify and prevent the practice of cards being used for unauthorized, illegal or criminal purposes and you undertake to cooperate with Stripe and Elavon by providing any information that Stripe or Elavon requests in this regard, failing which you will be liable for any resulting losses, penalties, fines, damages or other remedies incurred by or imposed on Stripe or Elavon, and the Agreement may be terminated by Stripe or Elavon.

### 1. Registration

The Stripe Service is not made available to persons to accept card payments for personal, family or household purposes.

These fields may appear in your customers’ credit or debit card statements. To avoid customer confusion and transaction disputes, it is important that you enter a description that clearly identifies your business as well as an accurate site URL. You agree to indemnify us from any costs from disputes due to customers failing to recognize your business name on their statements.

### 3. Verification and Underwriting

To verify your identity, we will require additional information including without limitation parents’ name, nationality, date and place of birth, organization type, activity and date of formation of your company. We may also ask for additional information to help verify your identity and assess your business risk including business invoices, a personal identification document or other government issued identification, a business license, corporate structure information and ultimate beneficial owner. We may ask you for financial statements. We may request for your permission to do a physical inspection at your place of business and to examine books and records that pertain to your compliance with this Agreement. Your failure to comply with any of these requests within five (5) days may result in suspension or termination of your Stripe account. You authorize us to retrieve additional information about you from third parties and other identification services. Stripe may use your information to apply for card merchant acquiring accounts on your behalf with certain Card Networks.

After we have collected and verified all your information, Stripe will review your account and determine if you are eligible to use the Service. Stripe may also share your information with the issuing banks, the Card Networks and Elavon, which may also make a determination regarding your eligibility. We will notify you once your account has been either approved or deemed ineligible for use of the Service.
To determine if you are eligible to use the Service, we shall assess your business activities, the financial stability of your business and its partners, agents, owners and/or shareholders, any prior relationship you have with us, and any other financial analysis including criteria we may adopt at any time, including during the term of the Agreement.

Stripe may periodically update this information to determine whether you continue to meet our eligibility requirements.

### 5. Prohibited Businesses

You will not, under any circumstance, request a Cardholder to provide a copy of their card as a condition to performing a transaction. You will not require a Cardholder to provide any declaration waiving their right to challenge a transaction. Any such declaration or waiver will be considered null and void for the purposes of the Agreement.

You are solely responsible for all costs in connection with providing your goods and services to your customers through your website and shall comply with any standards Stripe or Elavon require of your website.

You will only provide the goods or services expressly requested by the Cardholder. You are responsible for the timely and accurate delivery of the correct quantity and quality of goods or services to the address provided by the Cardholder, as well for pricing and any guarantee. You are responsible for notifying the Cardholder in respect of confirmation of the order and delivery of the goods or services.

## <a id="section_c"></a> Section C: Processing Card Transactions and Receiving Your Funds

### 1. Processing Card Transactions

You agree that you will honour all eligible cards presented for payment by your customers for your goods and services in accordance with the Card Network Rules, this Agreement and any operating guides that Stripe or Elavon may provide you from time to time. You agree that you will obtain an authorization from the Card Network(s) for each card transaction, as required under the Network Rules, and will not submit a card transaction for settlement where there is a negative authorization or the card is otherwise expired. You acknowledge that the existence of an affirmative authorization from the Card Networks does not mean that a particular card transaction will not be subject to Chargeback, Reversal or Claim (each such term as defined in Section D(6) below) at a later date.

When performing a transaction, you agree that you will comply with the procedures, standards and obligations required in the Agreement, that Stripe and Elavon cannot be held responsible for transactions concluded in violation of this Agreement and that we may refuse to process transactions concluded in violation of this Agreement. Stripe and Elavon shall not be responsible for any losses borne by you, including lost profits or revenue, due to transactions concluded in violation of this Agreement not being processed. Elavon and Stripe cannot be held liable to you for the veracity of information provided by Cardholders when performing transactions.

You will not impose any fee or surcharge on a customer that seeks to use an eligible payment card. You will provide a receipt to the customer at the conclusion of the purchase transaction that includes all information required under Card Network Rules and applicable law.

You will submit all card transactions for processing no later than three (3) days from the date of authorization. You will maintain appropriate records of all card transactions for a period of at least five (5) years from the date of the transaction.
You will display all Card Network marks in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Card Networks, and will use such marks only to indicate that you accept their cards for payment.

### 2. Payouts and Transaction History

We will assign commercial credit to you and direct funds to be paid that have settled from the Card Networks to your specified bank settlement account in the amounts actually received (less our Fees and certain other amounts as defined below) for card transactions submitted to our Service. The payouts will be made to the bank account (“Bank Account”) you provide for in your Stripe account. The Bank Account must be an account located at a bank in Brazil and held in your business name. You are responsible for the accuracy and correctness of information regarding your Bank Account. Funds for any given transaction will not be transferred to your Bank Account until the transaction is deemed complete. Transactions will be deemed complete when we have received funds settling from the Card Networks and when we, Elavon or our processing financial institutions have accepted such funds. The actual timing of the transfers to your Bank Account of the settling funds will be subject to the Payout Schedule as defined below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that all credits for funds provided to you are provisional and subject to reversal including without limitation if there are adjustments for inaccuracies and errors (including rejects) and Chargebacks, Reversals or Claims in accordance with this Agreement and the Card Network payment rules, whether or not a transaction is charged back by the issuer of the Card or the Cardholder. Accordingly, you authorize us to initiate reversal or adjustment (debit or credit) entries to the Bank Account and to initiate or suspend such entries in accordance with this Agreement as may be necessary to grant or reverse provisional credit for any transaction.
After each payout of card settlement funds to your Bank Account, we will update information in your Stripe dashboard to reflect settlement. Information regarding your card transactions processed and settled with the Services (“Transaction History”) will be available to you when you login to our website using your Stripe account credentials. We provide a minimum of one year of Transaction History on our website. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Transaction History and your use of the Service.

### 3. Payout Schedule

Payout schedule refers to the time it takes for us to initiate a transfer to your Bank Account of settlement funds arising from card transactions processed through the Service (“Payout Schedule”). Once your Bank Account information has been reviewed, Stripe will initiate transfer of settlement funds (net of Fees, Chargebacks, Reversals, Claims and other funds owed to us for any reason) in accordance with the Payout Schedule, the terms of which will be made available to you when you login to our website using your Stripe credentials, and in accordance with the Card Network rules. The settlement funds should normally be credited to your Bank Account within 1-2 business days of us initiating the payout. We are not responsible for any action taken by the institution holding your Bank Account that may result in some or all of the funds not being credited to your Bank Account or not being made available to you in your Bank Account. You can contact Stripe to inquire about changing the timing of your Payout Schedule. Upon submitting a request, you will be informed of the process and requirements for Stripe to review your Payout Schedule.

Stripe and Elavon reserve the right to change the Payout Schedule or suspend payouts to your Bank Account should Stripe or Elavon determine it is necessary due to pending disputes, excessive or anticipated excessive Chargebacks or refunds, or other suspicious activity associated with your use of the Service or if required by law or court order.

### 4. Reconciliations and Errors

Your Transaction History will be available to you when you login to your Stripe account on our website. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for reconciling your Transaction History with your actual card payment transactions. You agree to notify us of any discrepancies arising from such reconciliation and verification. We will investigate any reported discrepancies and attempt to rectify any errors that you or we discover. In the event you are owed money as a result of the discrepancy, we will transfer funds to your Bank Account in the next scheduled payout. Your failure to notify us of an error or discrepancy in your Transaction History within sixty (60) days of when it first appears on your Transaction History will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you in connection with any such error or discrepancy in processing your card payments.

If you submit or cause us to process transactions erroneously, you agree to contact us immediately. We will investigate any reported errors and attempt to rectify any errors that you or we discover by crediting or debiting your Bank Account as appropriate. Stripe will only correct transactions that you process incorrectly if and when you notify us of such an error. Your failure to notify us of such a processing error within thirty (30) days of when it first appears on your Transaction History will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.

### 5. Refunds and Returns

By accepting this Services Agreement, you agree to submit any and all refunds and adjustments for returns of your products and services through the Stripe Service to the Cardholder’s Card in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and Card Network Rules. Card Network Rules require that you will (a) maintain a fair return, cancellation or adjustment policy; (b) disclose your return or cancellation policy to customers at the time of purchase; (c) not give cash refunds to a customer in connection with a Card sale, unless as required by law; and (d) not accept cash or any other item of value for preparing a Card sale refund.

Full refunds must be for the exact amount in Brazilian Reais of the original transaction including any taxes, handling charges, and other. The refund amount may not exceed the original sale amount except by an amount equal to any reimbursements to customer for postage costs incurred for product returns. Refunds processed though the Stripe Service must be submitted within sixty (60) days of the original transaction but in all cases, within three (3) days of approving the Cardholder refund.

For processed refunds, Stripe will deduct the refund amount (including any applicable Fees) from (e) settlement funds owed to you from processing of other card transactions; or (f) funds in any Reserve Account (as defined below). If these funds are not sufficient, you authorize Stripe to initiate a debit entry to your Bank Account in the amount necessary to complete the refund transaction to the Cardholder’s card. In the event Stripe cannot access your Bank Account by means of a debit entry, you agree to pay all funds owed to Stripe upon demand. You are solely responsible for accepting and processing returns of your products and services; Stripe has no responsibility or obligation for processing such returns.

### 6. Chargebacks

A Chargeback (defined below in Section D(6)) is typically caused when a customer disputes a charge that appears on their statement. A Chargeback may result in the reversal of a transaction, with the amount charged back to you. You can be assessed Chargebacks for: (a) customer disputes; (b) unauthorized or improperly authorized transactions; (b) transactions that do not comply with Card Network Rules or the terms of this Agreement or are allegedly unlawful or suspicious; or (c) any reversals for any reason by the Card Network, Elavon, or the Cardholder’s card issuing financial institution.

When a Chargeback is issued, you are immediately liable to Stripe for the full amount of payment of the Chargeback plus any associated Fees, fines, expenses or penalties (including those assessed by the Card Networks or Elavon). You agree that Stripe may recover these amounts by debiting your Bank Account associated with your Stripe account, debiting your Reserve Account, or setting off any amounts owed to you by us. If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you will pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including without limitation legal fees and other legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of us in connection with the collection of any unpaid Chargebacks unpaid by you.

Further, if we reasonably believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you under this Agreement until such time that: (d) a Chargeback is assessed due to a customer’s complaint, in which case we will retain the funds; (e) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the customer may dispute that the transaction has expired; or (f) we determine that a Chargeback on the transaction will not occur.

### 7. Contesting your Chargebacks

You or Stripe may elect to contest Chargebacks assessed to your Bank Account. Stripe may provide you with assistance including notifications and software to help contest your Chargebacks. We do not assume any liability for our role or assistance in contesting Chargebacks.

You agree to provide us with the necessary information, in a timely manner and at your expense, to investigate or help resolve any Chargeback. You also grant us permission to share records or other information required with the Cardholder, the Cardholder’s financial institution, Elavon and your financial institution to help resolve any disputes, and you will hold us harmless as to any liability related thereto. You acknowledge that your failure to provide us with complete and accurate information in a timely manner may result in an irreversible Chargeback being assessed.

If the Cardholder’s issuing financial institution or the Card Network does not resolve a dispute in your favor, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees from you as described in this Agreement.

We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating or investigating Chargeback disputes.

### 8. Excessive Chargebacks

At any point, Stripe, Elavon, or the Card Networks may determine that you are incurring excessive Chargebacks. Excessive Chargebacks may result in additional fees, penalties, or fines. Excessive Chargebacks may also result in additional controls and restrictions to your use of the Service, including without limitation: (a) changes to the terms of your Reserve Account; (b) increases to your applicable Fees; (c) delays in your Payout Schedule; or (d) possible suspension or termination of your Stripe account and the Service. The Card Networks may also place additional controls or restrictions as part of their own monitoring programs for merchants with excessive Chargebacks.

### 9. Stripe Fees

You agree to pay the Fees (“Fees”) assessed by us to you for providing the payment services described in this Agreement. These fees will be calculated pursuant to the Fee Schedule linked to and incorporated into this Agreement by reference. We reserve the right to revise our Fees at any time, provided that, with respect to increases in or the introduction of new Fees related to credit card and debit card transactions such increase in or new Fees will be subject to a ninety (90) day notice period to you. For greater certainty, notification is not required for fee changes made in accordance with predeterminations, if any, set out in the Fee Schedule. You are also obligated to pay all taxes and other charges imposed by any governmental authority, on the services provided under this Agreement.

You acknowledge that you are responsible for any penalties or fines imposed on Stripe or Elavon or directly on you by any Card Network, financial institution or regulatory body as a result of your activities.

You acknowledge that you are also responsible for any legitimate expenses that Stripe or Elavon incurs in relation to any of your responsibilities or liabilities in the Agreement including, without limitation, court orders, stop payment orders, pledges and foreclosures.

You hereby agree that we may charge any Fees or other payments you owe us through bank slips (boletos bancários).

### 10. Our Collection Rights

To the extent permitted by law, we may collect any obligations you owe us under this Agreement by deducting the corresponding amounts from the Reserve Account or from funds payable to you arising from the settlement of card transactions, as provided in Article 368 et seq. of the Brazilian Civil Code. Fees will be assessed at the time a transaction is processed and will be first deducted from the funds received for such transactions. If the settlement amounts or Reserve Account are not sufficient to meet your obligations to us, we may charge or debit the Bank Account or credit card registered in your Stripe account for any amounts owed to us. Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand will be a material breach of this Agreement. You will be liable for our costs associated with collection in addition to the amount owed, including without limitation legal fees and expenses, costs of any arbitration or court proceeding, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.

Additionally, we may require a personal guarantee from a principal of a business for funds owed under this Agreement. If we require a personal guarantee we will specifically inform you.

### 11. Reserves

Funds held in reserves are amounts of money set aside by Stripe in an account maintained by it to cover Chargebacks, refunds, or other payment obligations under this Agreement (a “Reserve Account”). Stripe, in its sole discretion, will set the terms of the Reserve Account and notify you of such terms, which may require that a certain amount (including the full amount) of the funds received for card transactions we process for you is held for a period of time or that additional amounts are held in Reserve Account. Stripe, in its sole discretion, may elect to change the terms of the Reserve Account at any time for any reason based on your payment processing history or as requested by Elavon.

Stripe may fund the Reserve Account by means of: (a) any funds payouts made or due to you for card transactions submitted to the Service; (b) amounts available in your Bank Account by means of a debit to that Bank Account; (c) other sources of funds associated with your Stripe account; or (d) requesting that you provide funds to Stripe for deposit to the Reserve Account. You agree you are not entitled to any interest or other compensation associated with the funds held in the Reserve Account, that you have no right to direct that account, that you have no legal interest in those funds or that account and that you may not assign any interest in those funds or that account.

### 12. Security Interest

As a condition of providing you, or continuing to provide you, the Stripe Services Agreement, Stripe reserves the right to require you to enter into a separate security agreement granting Stripe and the Designated Bank a security interest in all funds on deposit in the Reserve Account.  You will cooperate reasonably with Stripe in the execution, delivery and performance of such a security agreement, and you hereby agree that Stripe will have the right to register any such security agreement with the register of deeds or other applicable governmental bodies.

### 13. Débito Automático

You authorize us and our respective vendors and agents to initiate debit and credit entries to the Bank Account for an indeterminate period of time in accordance with this Agreement. You undertake to perform any and all necessary actions to inform your bank about such authorization, and to give effect to the terms and conditions of this Section, as provided under Brazilian law. You hereby waive the right to receive advance notice from us and our vendors and agents of any and all such debits. This authorization will remain in effect after termination of this Agreement and until all of your obligations to us have been paid in full. If you change the Bank Account, this authorization for débito automático will apply to the new account and you shall provide us in writing such information regarding the new account as we deem necessary. Such new account shall thereafter be and become the “Bank Account” for the purpose of this Agreement. It may take us up to ten (10) business days after receipt of a written notice from you to reflect in our system any change to the Bank Account. If you change the Bank Account, you agree that you are responsible for all costs incurred by us in connection with your decision to change the Bank Account. You may revoke this authorization for débito automático at any time, but any such revocation shall give us the right to terminate this Agreement. You may obtain further information on your right to cancel the authorization for débito automático by contacting your financial institution.

##<a id="section_d"></a> Section D: Assignment Of Rights

If you process transactions that exceed thresholds set by the Card Networks, members of the payment methods market, Elavon or applicable law in force for at least twelve (12) months, you will have a direct relationship with Elavon. In accordance with this Section, you will assign certain of your rights under the Agreement to Stripe, which will provide services regarding the capture and routing of transactions and the collection of receivable funds, following the relevant procedure defined by Elavon.

In accordance with this Section, and respecting all of the terms of the Agreement, Stripe will act on your behalf in respect of Elavon, to:

(c) Request the enabling or disabling of your account for the processing of transactions through Elavon’s system;
(d) Conduct the certification, operation and monitoring of capture solutions to enable the integration of such solutions with Elavon’s system;
(e) Request delivery and/or enabling of capture solutions;
(f) Concentrate and route payment transactions with cards for Elavon’s system through the network and infrastructure, systems, platforms and capture solutions owned or managed by Stripe;
(g) Receive, address and answer challenges and transaction disputes raised by Elavon, Card Issuers and/or the Card Networks;
(h) Request, if desired, an advance on receivables due to you;
(i) Receive the net amounts due to you as a result of transactions with cards carried out through Elavon’s system and pass on the amounts due to you in the agreed form and deadline;
(j) Access, treat, address questions and pass on the data contained in the transaction and the payment reports that support the financial reconciliation of your account;
(k) Address and intermediate the resolution of disputes and challenges related to operational, technical, transactional and/or payment issues raised by you in relation to Elavon or by Elavon in relation to you;
(l) Coordinate solutions and necessary adjustments to support and serve your account.

In accordance with this Section, and respecting all applicable law, you assign and transfer to Stripe all the rights and liabilities listed above such that Stripe acts on your behalf in respect of Elavon.

Pursuant to the assignment of rights hereby agreed, you, Stripe and Elavon recognize that all of your rights and prerogatives regarding the receipt of credits and other liabilities listed above shall be exercised exclusively by Stripe, regardless of any other term or condition. You expressly authorize Elavon to pay the credits directly to Stripe and to comply with all guidelines given by Stripe, in accordance with the terms of this assignment, and with no further claims against Elavon regarding such payments.

You expressly authorize Elavon to disclose to Stripe details of all transactions performed by you, including information regarding returns, cancelling and chargebacks.

You expressly recognize that the settlement funds passed on to Stripe will be settled to you based on net values of card transactions, with any and all taxes, fees, rates, charges, chargebacks, indemnities, adjustments, deductions, rebates and other amounts due to Elavon and/or to third parties deducted, and excluding the irregular transactions canceled, contested or subject to any form of non-payment, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Stripe shall be solely and exclusively responsible for receiving and passing on to you the settlement funds due under this Agreement within the terms and form agreed upon by the parties. You exempt Elavon from any liability regarding payment of settlement funds to you under this Agreement and acknowledge Stripe as solely responsible for the settlement of funds to you.

If any provision of this section is considered invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any competent court, such provision shall be deemed modified so that it becomes valid, legal and effective to the maximum extent permitted by law. The other provisions of this section shall not be affected, remaining in full force and effect.

You cannot use receivables that you are due to receive under the Stripe Services Agreement as collateral for any credit limit, loan or other credit-related financial transaction, without the explicit approval of Stripe. You cannot lock your banking domicile, nor consent to having your banking domicile locked by your bank, under the Sistema de Controle de Garatias (SCG) system without the explicit approval of Stripe.
Information regarding any such amendment of the banking domicile shall be notified to Elavon by the financial institution itself or by an independent entity which  centralizes such information. In the event the members of the payment methods market come to implement a new model for amendment of banking domiciles, you hereby agree that Elavon will be entitled to send all the necessary information to the independent entity responsible for centralizing such information.

If your bank locks your banking domicile or an account withhold is placed on your bank account, Elavon will deposit funds at whatever banking domicile is reported to Elavon and/or Stripe by the SCG. You acknowledge and agree that under this section, if you have a locked banking domicile, the funds will be deposited directly by Elavon, deducting only Elavon's fees. However, you also agree that Stripe reserves the right to collect the Stripe Fees on these transactions as Stripe sees fit.
The parties recognize that if, at any time during the term of this Agreement, the Card Networks or regulators regulate the business model which is the object of this agreement, all efforts will be made to meet the requirements and rules imposed.

### 6. Your Liability

You are responsible for all Reversals, Chargebacks, Claims, fines, fees, penalties and other liability arising out of or relating to your breach of Card Network Rules and this Agreement, and/or your use of the Service. You agree to reimburse your customer, Stripe, Elavon and any third party specified by Stripe or Elavon (each, a “Disclaiming Entity”) for any and all such liability. “Chargeback” means a request that a buyer customer files directly with his or her card company or card issuing financial institution to invalidate a processed payment. “Claim” means a challenge to a payment that you or a buyer customer files directly with Stripe. “Reversal” means Stripe reverses the settlement of funds from a processed card transaction that you received because (a) the card transaction is invalidated by the card issuer; (b) the settlement funds were sent to you in error by (i) Stripe; (ii) Elavon, processors, suppliers or licensors of Stripe; or (iii) any of the respective affiliates, agents, directors and employees of any of the entities listed in (i) or (ii) above; (c) the sender of the payment did not have authorization to send the payment (for example: the buyer used a card that did not belong to the buyer); (d) you received the payment for activities that violated this Agreement or any Card Network Rules; or (e) Stripe decided a Claim against you.

You hereby acknowledge that transactions performed where a card is not present are, in all situations, at your sole risk and you are fully liable for any disputes, cancellations, penalties, losses and damages related to such transactions, even if you have complied with all your obligations under this Agreement.

Stripe, as an agent acting on behalf of Elavon, will have the final decision-making authority with respect to Claims, including without limitation claims for refunds for purchased items that are filed with Stripe by you or your customers. You will be required to reimburse Stripe for your liability. Your liability will include the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost (and in some cases you may not receive the item back). You will not receive a refund of any fees paid to Stripe due to any canceled transactions.

Without limiting the foregoing, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Stripe, Elavon and each of our respective officers, employees and agents (collectively “Disclaiming Entities”) from and against any claim, suit, demand, loss, liability, damage, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to (f) your breach of any provision of this Agreement; (g) your use of the Service, including without limitation any Reversals, Chargebacks, Claims, fines, fees, penalties and attorneys fees; (h) your, or your officer’s, employee’s, agent’s or subcontractor’s, negligence or willful misconduct; (i) third party indemnity obligations Stripe or Elavon incur as a direct or indirect result of your acts or omissions (including indemnification of any Card Network or Issuer); and/or (j) any kind of indemnification Stripe or Elavon are obliged to pay related to your consumer claims. You are solely responsible to resolve directly with your customers any claim about characteristics, quality, quantity, properties, origin, price, functioning, warranties, defects of the products you sell or the services you render to your customers. Elavon, Stripe, the Card Networks and the Card Issuer shall be exempt from any liability that may arise in this regard, including under the Consumer Protection Code, and shall be indemnified in the event of any imputation of responsibility or liability.
You acknowledge and agree that Stripe and Elavon’s responsibility is limited to the performance of their obligations as described in the Agreement. Any obligations or encumbrances arising directly or indirectly from any administrative or legal proceedings derived from breach of any obligation, either principal or accessory, by you and promoted by any federal or local authority shall be fully borne by you.
You shall reimburse Stripe and/or Elavon for any damages suffered as a result of fines and/or penalties imposed by the Card Networks, Card Issuers or any governmental authorities due to your failure to comply with their rules and requirements. Stripe and/or Elavon shall not be jointly or vicariously liable for your non-compliance with any obligation that is attributable to you and you will be solely responsible for the consequences derived from any non-compliance with your obligations.

If you are liable for any amounts owed to Stripe, Stripe may immediately remove such amounts from your Reserve Account and deduct the amounts owed to Stripe from such Reserve Account funds. If you do not have sufficient funds in the Reserve Account to cover your liability, you will be required to immediately add additional funds to your Reserve Account to cover funds owed to Stripe. If you do not do so, Stripe may engage in collections efforts to recover such amounts from you at your cost and expense.

Você somente irá aceitar pagamentos através da Stripe para operações entre você e seu cliente no caso de venda em boa-fé de bens ou serviços lícitos. Você não irá aliciar ou usar os Dados do Cartão de um Titular do Cartão para qualquer finalidade, salvo para o processamento do pagamento relativo a seus bens e serviços.
Sob nenhuma circunstância, você irá solicitar ao Titular do Cartão uma cópia de seu cartão como condição para a realização da operação. Você não irá exigir que um Titular do Cartão forneça qualquer declaração renunciando ao seu direito de questionar uma operação. Qualquer declaração dessa natureza ou renúncia será considerada nula e inválida para os fins deste Contrato.

Você será exclusivamente responsável por todos os custos associados ao fornecimento de seus bens e serviços aos seus clientes através do seu website e deverá observar quaisquer padrões exigidos pela Stripe ou pela Elavon para seu website.

Você somente irá fornecer os bens ou serviços expressamente solicitados pelo Titular do Cartão. Você será responsável pela entrega pontual e exata da quantidade e qualidade corretas dos bens ou serviços ao endereço fornecido pelo Titular do Cartão, bem como pela determinação do preço e de eventual garantia. Você será responsável pela notificação de confirmação de pedido e de entrega dos bens ou serviços ao Titular do Cartão.

Você não poderá realizar operações utilizando equipamento POS ou outros meios de captura que não tenham sido autorizados pela Stripe ou pela Elavon e o descumprimento dessa obrigação acarretará o pagamento de uma multa, sem natureza compensatória, no valor de R$50.000,00 (cinquenta mil reais).
Você concorda em apresentar à Stripe e à Elavon, se solicitado, prova de formalização legal da operação e, no caso de questionamento de uma operação pelo Titular do Cartão, uma cópia de toda a documentação comprobatória da operação questionada.

Você irá observar todas as leis, regras, regulamentos e ordens aplicáveis dos governos com jurisdição sobre seu uso do Serviço.

# Cláusula C: Processamento das Operações com Cartões e Recebimento dos Seus Recursos

## 1. Processamento das Operações com Cartões

Você concorda em honrar todos os cartões elegíveis apresentados para pagamento pelos seus clientes em consideração aos seus bens e serviços em conformidade com os Regulamentos dos Arranjos de Pagamento, este Contrato e quaisquer diretrizes operacionais que a Stripe ou Elavon possam fornecer a você a qualquer momento. Você concorda em obter uma autorização do(s) Instituidor(es) de Arranjos de Pagamento para cada operação com cartão, conforme exigido pelos Regulamentos dos Arranjos de Pagamento, e não irá apresentar uma operação com cartão para sua liquidação se existir uma autorização negativa ou se o cartão estiver de outra forma vencido. Você reconhece que a existência de uma autorização afirmativa dos Instituidores de Arranjos de Pagamento não significa que uma operação específica com cartão não será objeto de Chargeback, Reversão ou Reivindicação (cada termo, conforme definido na Cláusula D(6) abaixo) posteriormente.

Ao realizar uma operação, você concorda em observar os procedimentos, padrões e obrigações exigidos no Contrato, que a Stripe e a Elavon não poderão ser responsabilizadas pelas operações concluídas em violação a este Contrato e que a Stripe poderá recusar o processamento de operações concluídas em violação ao presente instrumento. A Stripe e a Elavon não serão responsáveis por quaisquer perdas arcadas que você sofrer, inclusive por lucros cessantes ou perda de receitas, em razão do não processamento de operações concluídas em violação a este Contrato. A Elavon e a Stripe não poderão ser responsabilizadas pela veracidade das informações fornecidas pelos Titulares dos Cartões ao realizarem as operações.
Você não irá impor nenhuma taxa ou sobretaxa a um cliente que pretenda usar um cartão de pagamento compatível. Você irá entregar o comprovante ao cliente quando a operação de compra tiver sido concluída, o qual irá incluir todas as informações exigidas pelos Regulamentos dos Arranjos de Pagamento e pela legislação aplicável.

Você irá apresentar todas as operações com cartões para seu processamento no máximo 3 (três) dias contados da data da autorização. Você irá manter os registros apropriados de todas as operações com cartões pelo período de, no mínimo, 5 (cinco) anos contados da data da operação.

Você irá exibir todas as marcas dos Instituidores de Arranjos de Pagamento em conformidade com as regras e procedimentos dos Instituidores de Arranjos de Pagamento, e somente irá usar as referidas marcas para indicar sua aceitação dos seus cartões para seu pagamento.

##2. Transferências e Histórico de Operações

A Stripe irá alocar um crédito comercial a você e direcionar o pagamento de recursos que sejam quitados pelos Instituidores de Arranjos de Pagamento para a sua conta de liquidação especificada, nos valores efetivamente recebidos (menos as Taxas da Stripe e alguns valores adicionais definidos abaixo) para as operações com cartões submetidas ao Serviço Stripe. As transferências serão efetuadas para a conta corrente (“Conta Corrente”) especificada por você na sua conta Stripe. A Conta Corrente deverá ser uma conta mantida em um banco no Brasil, sob a sua denominação social. Você será responsável pela exatidão e precisão das informações sobre a sua Conta Corrente. Os recursos de qualquer operação não serão transferidos para sua Conta Corrente até que a operação seja considerada como tendo sido concluída. As operações serão consideradas como tendo sido concluídas quando a Stripe tiver recebido os recursos para sua liquidação dos Instituidores de Arranjos de Pagamento e quando a Stripe, a Elavon ou as instituições financeiras de processamento tiverem aceito os referidos recursos. O momento exato das transferências dos recursos para sua Conta Corrente estará condicionado ao Cronograma de Transferências, conforme definido abaixo. Não obstante o disposto acima, você reconhece que todos os créditos de recursos concedidos a você são provisórios e estão sujeitos à sua reversão, incluindo, sem limitação, no caso de ajustes por inexatidões e erros (inclusive recusas) e Chargebacks, Reversões ou Reivindicações em conformidade com este Contrato e as regras de pagamento dos Instituidores dos Arranjos de Pagamento, independentemente do chargeback da operação pela emissora do Cartão ou pelo Titular do Cartão. Portanto, você autoriza a Stripe a iniciar o débito ou crédito de reversões ou ajustes em sua Conta Corrente e a iniciar ou suspender esses débitos ou créditos em conformidade com este Contrato se necessário para a concessão ou reversão de um crédito provisório de qualquer operação.

Após cada transferência de recursos de liquidação de cartões para sua Conta Corrente, a Stripe irá atualizar as informações em seu quadro no Serviço Stripe para refletir essa liquidação. As informações sobre suas operações com cartões processadas e liquidadas através dos Serviços (“Histórico de Operações”) estarão disponíveis quando você efetuar o login no website da Stripe usando as credenciais de sua conta no Serviço Stripe. A Stripe irá fornecer o Histórico de Operações de, no mínimo, um ano no website da Stripe. Exceto diversamente exigido por lei, você será exclusivamente responsável pela compilação e manutenção dos arquivos permanentes de todas as operações e dos demais dados associados ao seu Histórico de Operações e ao seu uso do Serviço.

##3. Cronograma de Transferências

O cronograma de transferências se refere ao período necessário para que a Stripe inicie uma transferência para a sua Conta Corrente dos recursos de liquidação decorrentes das operações com cartões processadas através do Serviço (“Cronograma de Transferências”). Assim que as informações de sua Conta Corrente tiverem sido analisadas, a Stripe irá iniciar a transferência dos recursos de liquidação (deduzidas as Taxas, Chargebacks, Reversões, Reivindicações e outros recursos devidos à Stripe a qualquer título) em conformidade com o Cronograma de Transferências, cujos termos estarão disponíveis quando você efetuar o login no website da Stripe utilizando as suas credenciais no Serviço Stripe, e em consonância com as regras/regulamentos dos Instituidores de Arranjos de Pagamento. Os recursos de liquidação serão normalmente creditados em sua Conta Corrente no prazo de 1-2 dias úteis do início da transferência pela Stripe. A Stripe não será responsável por qualquer ato praticado pela instituição na qual sua Conta Corrente seja mantida que possa resultar que os recursos não sejam total ou parcialmente creditados em sua Conta Corrente ou na indisponibilidade desses recursos em sua Conta Corrente. Você poderá entrar em contato com a Stripe para solicitar uma mudança no seu Cronograma de Transferências. Ao apresentar esse pedido, você será informado do processo e dos requisitos para a revisão do seu Cronograma de Transferências pela Stripe.

A Stripe e a Elavon reservam o direito de alterar o Cronograma de Transferências ou de suspender as transferências para a sua Conta Corrente se a Stripe ou a Elavon determinarem que seja necessário em razão de litígios pendentes, Chargebacks ou restituições excessivos ou previstos ou outra atividade suspeita associada ao seu uso do Serviço ou se exigido por lei ou por ordem judicial.

##4. Reconciliações e Erros

Seu Histórico de Operações estará disponível quando você efetuar o login em sua conta no Serviço no website da Stripe. Exceto se diversamente exigido por lei, você será exclusivamente responsável pela reconciliação de seu Histórico de Operações com as suas operações de pagamento com cartões. Você concorda em notificar a Stripe de quaisquer discrepâncias decorrentes da referida reconciliação e verificação. A Stripe irá investigar quaisquer discrepâncias relatadas e tentará retificar quaisquer erros que você ou a Stripe venha a descobrir. Se você tiver qualquer crédito em decorrência da discrepância, a Stripe irá transferir os recursos para a sua Conta Corrente na próxima transferência programada. Se você não notificar a Stripe de um erro ou discrepância em seu Histórico de Operações no prazo de 60 (sessenta) dias de sua primeira ocorrência em seu Histórico de Operações, será considerado que houve uma renúncia a qualquer direito aos valores devidos a você em relação a qualquer erro ou discrepância no processamento de seus pagamentos com cartões.

Se você apresentar ou causar o processamento errôneo de uma operação, você concorda em contatar a Stripe imediatamente. A Stripe irá investigar quaisquer erros reportados e tentará retificar quaisquer erros que tenham sido descobertos por você ou pela Stripe por meio de um crédito ou débito em sua Conta Corrente, conforme apropriado. A Stripe somente irá corrigir as operações que tenham sido processadas incorretamente se e quando você notificar a Stripe de um erro. Se você não notificar a Stripe de um erro de processamento no prazo de 30 (trinta) dias de sua primeira ocorrência em seu Histórico de Operações, será considerado que houve uma renúncia a qualquer direito aos valores devidos a você.

##5. Restituições e Devoluções

Ao aceitar estes Termos de Serviço, você concorda em apresentar todas e quaisquer restituições e ajustes de devoluções de seus produtos e serviços através do Serviço Stripe ao Cartão do Titular do Cartão em conformidade com os termos deste Contrato e os Regulamentos dos Arranjos de Pagamento. Os Regulamentos dos Arranjos de Pagamento exigem que você (i) mantenha uma política justa de devolução, cancelamento ou ajuste; (ii) divulgue sua política de devolução ou cancelamento aos clientes no momento da compra; (iii) não conceda restituições em dinheiro para um cliente em relação a uma venda com Cartão, salvo se exigido por lei; e (iv) não aceite dinheiro ou qualquer outro item de valor para a preparação de uma restituição de uma venda com Cartão.

Todas as restituições deverão ter o valor exato em reais da operação original, incluindo quaisquer tributos, cobranças de movimentação e outras. O valor da restituição não poderá ser superior ao valor da venda original, exceção feita a um valor equivalente a quaisquer reembolsos ao cliente pelos custos postais incorridos para a devolução de um produto. As restituições processadas através do Serviço Stripe deverão ser apresentadas no prazo de 60 (sessenta) dias contados da operação original, mas, em todos os casos, no prazo de 3 (três) dias contados da aprovação da restituição ao Titular do Cartão.

Para as restituições processadas, a Stripe irá deduzir o valor restituído (inclusive quaisquer Taxas aplicáveis) (i) dos recursos de liquidação devidos a você pelo processamento de outras operações com cartões; ou (ii) dos recursos em qualquer Conta Reserva (conforme definição abaixo). Se esses recursos não forem suficientes, você autoriza a Stripe a debitar de sua Conta Corrente o valor necessário para a conclusão da operação de restituição ao cartão do Titular do Cartão. Se a Stripe não puder acessar sua Conta Corrente por meio de um débito, você concorda em pagar todos os recursos devidos à Stripe mediante sua solicitação. Você será exclusivamente responsável pela aceitação e processamento de devoluções de seus produtos e serviços; a Stripe não terá nenhuma obrigação ou responsabilidade pelo processamento das referidas devoluções.

##6. Chargebacks

Um Chargeback (definido abaixo na Cláusula D(6)) é normalmente causado quando um cliente questiona um débito que conste de seu demonstrativo. Um Chargeback poderá resultar na reversão de uma operação, na qual o valor será cobrado de você. Você será responsável pelos Chargebacks em razão de: (i) questionamentos de um cliente; (ii) operações não autorizadas ou que tenham sido indevidamente autorizadas; (iii) operações que não observem os Regulamentos dos Arranjos de Pagamento ou os termos deste Contrato ou que sejam alegadamente ilegais ou suspeitas; ou (iv) quaisquer reversões, por qualquer motivo, por um Instituidor de Arranjo de Pagamento, pela Elavon, ou pela instituição financeira emissora do cartão do Titular do Cartão.

Na ocorrência de um Chargeback, você será imediatamente responsável perante a Stripe pelo valor integral do pagamento do Chargeback, mais as respectivas Taxas, multas, despesas ou penalidades (inclusive aquelas cobradas pelos Instituidores de Arranjos de Pagamento ou pela Elavon). Você concorda que a Stripe poderá ser ressarcida através do débito desse valor em sua Conta Corrente associada à sua conta no Serviço Stripe, por meio de um débito em sua Conta Reserva, ou através da compensação com quaisquer valores devidos a você pela Stripe. Se a Stripe não puder ser ressarcida dos recursos relacionados a um Chargeback de sua responsabilidade, você irá imediatamente pagar para a Stripe o valor integral do Chargeback, mediante sua solicitação. Você concorda em pagar todos os custos e despesas, incluindo, entre outros, honorários advocatícios e outras despesas legais, incorridos pela ou em nome da Stripe para a cobrança de qualquer Chargeback que não tenha sido pago por você.

Ademais, se a Stripe razoavelmente acreditar que provavelmente ocorrerá um Chargeback de qualquer operação, a Stripe poderá reter o valor equivalente ao possível Chargeback dos pagamentos de outra forma devidos a você nos termos deste Contrato até que: (a) o Chargeback seja devido em razão da reclamação de um cliente, sendo que, nesse caso, a Stripe irá reter os recursos; (b) tenha transcorrido o prazo, nos termos das leis ou regulamentos aplicáveis, durante o qual um cliente possa questionar a operação em questão; ou (c) a Stripe tenha determinado que não irá ocorrer o Chargeback da operação.

##7. Contestação dos seus Chargebacks

Você ou a Stripe poderão contestar um Chargeback debitado de sua Conta Corrente. A Stripe poderá assistir você, inclusive por meio de notificações e software, para a contestação de seus Chargebacks. A Stripe não assume nenhuma responsabilidade por outra função ou assistência na contestação de Chargebacks.

Você concorda em prestar as informações necessárias à Stripe, de maneira pontual e às suas expensas, para a investigação ou para ajudar na solução de qualquer Chargeback. Você também autoriza a Stripe a compartilhar arquivos ou outras informações necessárias ao Titular do Cartão, à instituição financeira do Titular do Cartão, à Elavon e à sua instituição financeira para a solução de quaisquer litígios, e você irá eximir a Stripe de qualquer responsabilidade nesse sentido. Você reconhece que o não fornecimento de informações completas e exatas à Stripe de maneira pontual poderá acarretar na irreversibilidade de um débito de Chargeback.
Se a instituição financeira emissora do Titular do Cartão ou o Instituidor do Arranjo de Pagamento não resolver um litígio a seu favor, a Stripe poderá ser ressarcida do valor do Chargeback e de quaisquer taxas associadas conforme descrito neste Contrato.

A Stripe reserva o direito, através do envio de uma notificação, de cobrar de você uma taxa de mediação ou de investigação de litígios de Chargeback.

##8. Chargebacks Excessivos

A qualquer momento, a Stripe, a Elavon, ou os Instituidores de Arranjos de Pagamento poderão determinar que você está incorrendo em Chargebacks excessivos. Os Chargebacks excessivos poderão resultar em taxas, penalidades ou multas adicionais. Os Chargebacks excessivos poderão também resultar em novos controles e restrições ao uso do Serviço, incluindo, entre outros: (i) alterações aos termos de sua Conta Reserva; (ii) aumentos das suas Taxas aplicáveis; (iii) atrasos em seu Cronograma de Transferências; ou (iv) possível suspensão ou encerramento de sua conta na Stripe e do Serviço. Os Instituidores de Arranjos de Pagamento também poderão impor novos controles ou restrições como parte de seu próprio programa de monitoramento para estabelecimentos com Chargebacks excessivos.

##9. Taxas da Stripe

Você concorda em pagar as Taxas (“Taxas”) cobradas pela Stripe pela prestação dos serviços de pagamento descritos neste Contrato. As referidas taxas serão calculadas de acordo com o Anexo de Taxas, incorporado a este Contrato por referência e cujo link consta neste Contrato. A Stripe reserva o direito de rever as suas Taxas a qualquer momento, estabelecido que, em relação aos aumentos ou à introdução de novas Taxas pertinentes às operações com cartões de crédito e com cartões de débito, esse aumento ou as novas Taxas estarão condicionados ao envio a você de uma notificação com 90 (noventa) dias de antecedência. Para maior clareza, não será necessária uma notificação para as mudanças de taxas predeterminadas, se aplicável, conforme previsto no Anexo de Taxas. Você também está obrigado a pagar todos os tributos e outras cobranças impostas por qualquer autoridade governamental, sobre os serviços prestados nos termos deste Contrato.
Você reconhece que você será responsável por quaisquer penalidades ou multas impostas à Stripe ou à Elavon ou diretamente a você por qualquer Instituidor de Arranjo de Pagamento, por uma instituição financeira ou por um órgão regulatório em decorrência de suas atividades.

Você reconhece que você também será responsável por quaisquer despesas legítimas que a Stripe ou a Elavon venha a incorrer em relação a quaisquer de suas responsabilidades ou obrigações no Contrato, incluindo, sem limitação, ordens judiciais, ordens de interrupção de pagamento, cauções ou excussões.
Pelo presente instrumento, você concorda que a Stripe poderá efetuar a cobrança de quaisquer Taxas ou outros pagamentos devidos à Stripe através de boletos bancários.

##10. Direitos de Cobrança da Stripe

Na extensão permitida em lei, a Stripe poderá cobrar quaisquer obrigações por você devidas à Stripe nos termos deste Contrato, através da dedução dos valores correspondentes de sua Conta Reserva ou dos recursos devidos a você em decorrência da liquidação das operações com cartões, consoante o disposto no Artigo 368 e seguintes do Código Civil Brasileiro. As Taxas irão incidir quando ocorrer o processamento da operação e serão primeiramente deduzidas dos recursos recebidos em decorrência das referidas operações. Se os valores liquidados ou a Conta Reserva não forem suficientes para a quitação de suas obrigações, a Stripe poderá cobrar ou debitar da Conta Corrente ou do cartão de crédito registrado em sua conta no Serviço Stripe quaisquer valores devidos à Stripe. O não pagamento integral dos valores devidos à Stripe, quando solicitado, consistirá uma violação relevante a este Contrato. Você será responsável pelos custos da Stripe associados à cobrança, em acréscimo ao valor devido, incluindo, sem limitação, os honorários advocatícios e despesas, custos de qualquer processo arbitral ou judicial, taxas de agências de cobrança e quaisquer juros aplicáveis.

Adicionalmente, a Stripe poderá exigir uma garantia pessoal de um sócio de pessoa jurídica para os recursos devidos à Stripe nos termos deste Contrato. Se a Stripe exigir uma garantia pessoal, a Stripe irá especificamente informá-lo.

##11. Reservas

Os recursos mantidos em contas reservas representam os valores em dinheiro alocados pela Stripe em uma conta mantida pela Stripe, para cobrir eventuais Chargebacks, restituições ou outras obrigações de pagamento nos termos deste Contrato (uma “Conta Reserva”). A Stripe, a seu exclusivo critério, irá estabelecer os termos da Conta Reserva e irá notificá-lo desses termos, os quais poderão exigir que um determinado valor (inclusive o valor integral) dos recursos recebidos pelas operações com cartões processadas pela Stripe em seu nome seja mantido por um período ou que outros valores sejam mantidos na Conta Reserva. A Stripe, a seu exclusivo critério, poderá alterar os termos da Conta Reserva a qualquer momento e por qualquer motivo considerando o seu histórico de processamento de pagamentos ou se solicitado pela Elavon.

A Stripe poderá providenciar recursos à Conta Reserva por meio de: (i) quaisquer transferências de recursos efetuadas ou devidas pelas operações com cartões apresentadas ao Serviço; (ii) valores disponíveis em sua Conta Corrente por meio de um débito na referida Conta Corrente; (iii) outras fontes de recursos associados à sua conta no Serviço Stripe; ou (iv) uma solicitação que você forneça recursos à Stripe para seu depósito na Conta Reserva. Você concorda que não terá direito a juros ou a outra remuneração associados aos recursos mantidos na Conta Reserva, que você não terá direito de orientar a referida conta, que você não terá participação legal sobre os referidos recursos ou sobre a referida conta e que você não poderá ceder qualquer participação sobre os referidos recursos ou sobre a referida conta.

##12. Direito de Garantia

Como condição à prestação dos Serviços Stripe ou à continuidade da prestação dos Serviços Stripe, a Stripe reserva o direito de exigir que você celebre um contrato de garantia separado, outorgando à Stripe e ao Banco Designado um direito de garantia sobre todos os recursos depositados na Conta Reserva.  Você irá razoavelmente cooperar com a Stripe na celebração, formalização e cumprimento do referido contrato de garantia, e neste ato você concorda que a Stripe terá o direito de registrar qualquer contrato de garantia perante o cartório de registro de títulos e documentos ou perante outros órgãos governamentais competentes.

##13. Débito Automático

Você autoriza a Stripe ou os respectivos fornecedores e representantes da Stripe a efetuarem débitos e créditos na Conta Corrente por um período indeterminado em conformidade com este Contrato. Você se compromete a praticar todos e quaisquer atos que sejam necessários para informar essa autorização ao seu banco e para a consecução dos termos e condições desta Cláusula, conforme previsto na legislação brasileira. Pelo presente instrumento, você renuncia ao direito de receber uma notificação prévia da Stripe e dos seus fornecedores e representantes com relação a todos e quaisquer débitos. Essa autorização permanecerá em vigor após a rescisão deste Contrato e até que todas as suas obrigações perante a Stripe tenham sido integralmente quitadas. No caso de qualquer mudança na Conta Corrente, essa autorização de débito automática será aplicável à nova conta e você deverá fornecer à Stripe, por escrito, as informações sobre a nova conta, conforme a Stripe considere necessário. A nova conta passará então e se tornará a “Conta Corrente” para os fins deste Contrato. Serão necessários até 10 (dez) dias úteis contados do recebimento de uma notificação escrita para que qualquer mudança na Conta Corrente esteja refletida no sistema da Stripe. No caso de qualquer mudança na Conta Corrente, você concorda que você será responsável por todos os custos incorridos pela Stripe relacionados à sua decisão de mudar a Conta Corrente. Você poderá revogar essa autorização de débito automático a qualquer momento, mas qualquer revogação outorgará à Stripe o direito de rescindir este Contrato. Você poderá obter outras informações sobre o seu direito de cancelamento da autorização de débito automático contatando a sua instituição financeira.

# Cláusula D: Cessão de Direitos

Se você efetuar o processamento de operações que excedam os limites estabelecidos pelos Instituidores de Arranjos de Pagamento, pelos membros do mercado de meios de pagamento, pela Elavon ou pela legislação aplicável em vigor por, no mínimo, 12 (doze) meses, você terá um relacionamento direto com a Elavon. Em conformidade com o disposto nesta Cláusula, você irá ceder alguns de seus direitos nos termos do Contrato para a Stripe, a qual irá prestar serviços relativos à captura e roteamento de operações e de cobrança dos recursos recebíveis, seguindo o respectivo procedimento definido pela Elavon.

Em conformidade com o disposto nesta Cláusula, e respeitando todos os termos do Contrato, a Stripe atuará em seu nome, perante a Elavon, para:

**(i)** Negociar preços, condições operacionais, níveis de serviço e outras condições necessárias para permitir a aceitação das operações de pagamento com cartões através do sistema da Elavon;
**(ii)** Fornecer determinados dados e informações necessários para permitir a afiliação, avaliação de risco e de crédito, fornecimento de soluções de captura e manutenção de sua conta;

**(viii)** Solicitar, se desejado, um adiantamento com base nos recebíveis devidos a você;
**(ix)** Receber os valores líquidos devidos a você em decorrência das operações com cartões efetuadas através do sistema da Elavon e transferir os valores devidos a você no formato e prazo acordados;

Em consonância com o disposto nesta Cláusula e respeitando toda a legislação aplicável, você cede e transfere para a Stripe todos os direitos e responsabilidades listados acima para que a Stripe possa atuar em seu nome perante a Elavon.
De acordo com a cessão de direitos aqui acordada, você, a Stripe e a Elavon reconhecem que todos os seus direitos e prerrogativas relacionados ao recebimento de créditos e outros passivos listados acima deverão ser exercidos exclusivamente pela Stripe, independentemente de qualquer outro termo ou condição. Você expressamente autoriza a Elavon a pagar os créditos diretamente à Stripe e a cumprir todas as diretrizes da Stripe, em conformidade com os termos dessa cessão e sem qualquer outra reivindicação perante a Elavon relacionada aos referidos pagamentos.

Você expressamente autoriza a Elavon a divulgar à Stripe as informações detalhadas de todas as operações realizadas por você, inclusive as informações sobre devoluções, restituições e cancelamentos.

Você expressamente reconhece que os recursos de liquidação transferidos à Stripe serão quitados a você com base nos valores líquidos das operações com cartões, com a dedução de todos e quaisquer tributos, taxas, tarifas, encargos, cancelamentos, indenizações, ajustes, deduções, abatimentos, e outros valores devidos à Elavon e/ou a terceiros, e excluídas as operações irregulares canceladas, contestadas ou sujeitas a qualquer forma de não pagamento, em conformidade com os termos deste Contrato.

A Stripe será única e exclusivamente responsável pelo recebimento e transferência a você dos recursos de liquidação devidos nos termos deste Contrato, observados os prazos e no formato acordado pelas partes. Você exime a Elavon de qualquer responsabilidade pelo pagamento dos recursos de liquidação a você nos termos deste Contrato e reconhece que a Stripe será exclusivamente responsável pela liquidação dos recursos a você.

Se qualquer disposição desta cláusula for considerada inválida, ilegal ou inexequível por qualquer foro competente, a referida disposição será considerada como tendo sido alterada para que se torne válida, legal e eficaz na extensão máxima permitida em lei. As demais disposições desta cláusula não serão afetadas, as quais permanecerão em pleno vigor e efeito.

Você não poderá usar os recebíveis devidos a você nos termos dos Serviços Stripe em garantia a qualquer limite de crédito, empréstimo ou outra operação financeira de crédito, sem a expressa aprovação da Stripe. Você não poderá travar seu domicílio bancário, nem concordar com a trava de seu domicílio bancário pelo seu banco, nos termos do Sistema de Controle de Garantias (SCG) sem a expressa aprovação da Stripe.

As informações relacionadas a qualquer alteração ao domicílio bancário deverão ser notificadas à Elavon pela própria instituição financeira ou por uma entidade independente que centralize as referidas informações. Se os membros do mercado de meios de pagamento vierem a implementar um novo modelo para a alteração de domicílios bancários, você neste ato concorda que a Elavon terá o direito de enviar todas as informações necessárias para a entidade independente responsável pela centralização das referidas informações.

Se o seu banco travar seu domicílio bancário ou for implementado o bloqueio de sua conta corrente, a Elavon irá depositar os recursos em qualquer domicílio bancário informado à Elavon e/ou à Stripe pelo SCG. Você reconhece e concorda que, nos termos desta cláusula, se o seu domicílio bancário for travado, os recursos serão depositados diretamente pela Elavon, deduzindo somente as taxas da Elavon. Entretanto, você também concorda que a Stripe reserva o direito de cobrar as Taxas da Stripe sobre as referidas operações, conforme a Stripe entenda apropriado.
As partes reconhecem que se, a qualquer momento durante o prazo de vigência deste Contrato, os Instituidores de Arranjos de Pagamento ou as agências regulatórias regulamentarem o modelo comercial objeto deste Contrato, todos os esforços serão envidados para que sejam observados os requisitos e as novas regras impostas.
