## Schedule 1 Operating Procedures

## PART A: CREDIT CARDS

We provide processing services to facilitate the passage of your Sales Receipts back to the thousands of institutions who issue the MasterCard® and Visa® and CUP and JCB Cards carried by your customers. This part of the Operating Procedures describes the procedures and methods for submitting Credit Card transactions for payment, obtaining Authorisations, responding to Chargebacks and Media Retrieval requests, and other aspects of the operations of our services.

They seek to provide you with the principles for a sound Card program. They are designed to help you decrease your Chargeback liability and train your Employees.

The Operating Procedures contained in this part focus primarily on the MasterCard, Visa Associations’ operating rules and regulations.

The requirements set out in these Operating Procedures will apply unless prohibited by law. You are responsible for following any additional or conflicting requirements imposed by the laws of the country specified in the Merchant Declaration and Agreement.

### 1 MASTERCARD AND VISA AND CUP AND JCB CARDS ACCEPTANCE

The written request must at least specify the transaction amounts, the frequency of recurring charges and the duration of time for which the Cardholder’s permission is granted.

(b) If the recurring transaction is renewed, the Cardholder must complete and deliver to you a subsequent request for the continuation of such goods or services to be charged to the Cardholder’s account. You must explain to the Cardholder how to stop receiving the goods and services. You may not complete a recurring transaction after receiving a cancellation notice from the Cardholder or Issuer or after a request for Authorisation has been denied.

(c) You must obtain an Authorisation for each transaction and write “Recurring Transaction” (or “P.O.” for MasterCard transactions) on the Sales Receipt in lieu of the Cardholder’s signature.

(e) You may not impose a finance charge in connection with a Recurring Transaction or Preauthorised Order.

(a) You cannot establish any special conditions for accepting a Card. However, for Credit Card transactions, where permitted by the Association Rules you may charge a surcharge in addition to the cash price of the goods or services.

(b) You cannot establish procedures that discourage, favour or discriminate against the use of any particular Card.

(c) You cannot require the Cardholder to supply any personal information (e.g., home or business phone number; home or business address; or driver’s licence number) unless instructed by the Call Centre operated by First Data Merchant
Solutions Pte Limited (“Call Centre”), in which case you (and FDMS) must comply with Privacy Laws in your country. The exception to this is for a mail/telephone order or delivery-required transactions.

(d) Any tax required to be collected must be included in the total transaction amount and not collected in cash.

(e) You cannot submit any transaction to re-finance or transfer of an existing Cardholder obligation deemed uncollectable or to cover a dishonoured cheque.

Failure to comply with any of the Association Rules may result in fines or penalties.

You are prohibited from depositing transactions originating from Cards of owners, partners or officers of your business establishment except for transactions that are routine in type, size and frequency for your business and that represent actual sales of goods or services. Submission of sales transactions on Cards in order to obtain a cash advance is strictly prohibited and may result in immediate cancellation of your account.

1.4 DISPLAYS AND ADVERTISING

You must display appropriate Visa or MasterCard or CUP or JCB and, if applicable, other Association decals and program marks on promotional materials as required by Association Rules. You may not indicate that Visa or MasterCard or CUP or JCB any other Association endorses your goods or services. You will permit any Issuer of CUP Cards to include the names and addresses of all or any sales/service outlets operated by you in any directories, guides or other promotional material (including but not limited to the Marketing Materials) used in connection with the CUP Card Programme

You confirm and acknowledge that all intellectual properties (including but not limited to trade mark) in the JCB Logo Mark, CUP symbol, the Visa symbol or the MasterCard symbol and in all the Marketing Materials which are produced and/or provided by JCB, CUP Visa and MasterCard are and shall remain the sole property of JCB, CUP, Visa and MasterCard respectively and for their branded Marketing Material. You have no right, interest and benefit of whatsoever nature in any of the intellectual properties (including but not limited to the trade mark) in the JCB Logo Mark, CUP symbol, the Visa symbol or the MasterCard symbol or in any of the Marketing Materials. You will not modify, alter and/or change and shall not apply and/or use, the JCB Logo Mark, the CUP symbol, the Visa symbol or the MasterCard symbol or in any of the Marketing Materials in any respect or any manner save and except as expressly permitted by and in strict accordance with the terms and conditions in this Agreement.

1.5 CASH PAYMENTS BY AND CASH DISBURSEMENTS TO CARDHOLDERS

1.6 SUSPECT TRANSACTIONS

(a) Fraud-Prone Merchandise Tips:

(i) Jewellery, video, stereo, computer and camera equipment, shoes and men’s clothing are typically fraud-prone because they can easily be resold.

(ii)  Be suspicious of high dollar amounts and transactions with more than one fraud-prone item, e.g., two VCRs, three gold chains, etc.

(iii) If you suspect fraud, call the relevant customer care line. If the terminal does not display the Card number, call the FDMS POS Help Desk for terminal assistance.

(b) Remember: An Authorisation code only indicates the availability of a Cardholder’s credit at the time of the transaction. It does not warrant that the person presenting the Card is the rightful Cardholder. If proper procedures are not followed at the time of the transaction, you are subject to a Chargeback and your account may be debited for the amount of the transaction.

(c) Card cancellation

From time to time we will issue instructions, through terminals and/or verbal and/or written instructions, to you concerning the presentation by customers of cancelled Cards and situations where the presentation or use of a Card arouses suspicion that a Card may be being used improperly. You must comply with our general and specific instructions to obtain the return of or repossession of any Card. You must ensure in so doing that such return or repossession of any Card will not give rise to any claim against us.

### 2.  COMPLETION OF SALES AND CREDIT RECEIPTS

(a) Internet transactions have a substantially higher risk of Chargeback. Since you will not have an imprinted or magnetically swiped transaction and you will not have the Cardholder’s signature on the Sales Receipt as you would in a face-to-face transaction, you will assume all risk associated with accepting a mail/ telephone/Internet order transaction. The following procedures, while they will not eliminate Chargebacks, are useful in reducing them:

(i) Obtain the expiration date of Card.

(ii)  You may not submit a transaction for processing until after the merchandise has been shipped or the service has been provided to the customer. (Visa will permit the immediate billing of merchandise manufactured to the customer’s specifications [i.e., special/custom orders] provided the Cardholder has been advised of the billing details.)

(iii) Notify the Cardholder of delivery time frames, special handling or of a cancellation policy. Merchandise shipping dates must be within seven (7) days of the date Authorisation was obtained. If, after the order has been taken, additional delays will be incurred (e.g., out of stock), notify the Cardholder and re-Authorise the transaction.

(iv)  You may not require a Cardholder to complete a postcard or other document that displays the Cardholder’s account number in clear view when mailed.

(v) If you accept orders via the Internet, your web site must include all the following information in a prominent manner:

- Complete description of the goods or services offered

- Merchandise return and refund policy

- Customer service contract, including email address and/or telephone number

- The transaction currency being your local currency, unless permission is otherwise received from FDMS)

- Any applicable export or legal restrictions

- Delivery policy

- Privacy policy

- A description of the transaction security used on your website and policy for the transmission of payment card details.

- A statement that the Merchant is responsible for the transaction, including the delivery of goods or services and for disputes and complaints in accordance with the terms applicable to the transaction.

- Country of your domicile.

(vi)  The sale or disclosure of databases containing Cardholder account numbers, personal information, or other Card transaction information to third parties is prohibited

(vii) Ensure the Card is not included in any notification (including any Joint Card Recovery Bulletin or Stop List) issued from time to time by the Associations to You regarding Cards that have been cancelled by a Card issuer.

(viii)  You must not require a Cardholder to waive their dispute rights or rights to Chargeback transactions in accordance with the Association Rules.

(b) If You engage in internet orders You may submit information that would otherwise be recorded on a Sales and Credit Receipt to us via the internet.

(c) You agree that we are not liable to You for any loss or damage caused by or arising from any failure by You or Your inability to submit Sales and Credit Receipt information to us via the internet.

(d) If the relevant Cardholder denies liability in respect of any /Internet transactions initiated or concluded by telephone or mail or internet, we shall be entitled to reimbursement of the amount paid to you. For the purpose of this clause 2(d) it is irrelevant whether you have observed the terms and conditions of this Agreement or obtained an Authorisation Approval Code from us.

### 5 AUTHORISATIONS

5.1 GENERAL

(a) You must obtain an Authorisation Approval Code from us for all transactions. Failure to obtain an Authorisation Approval Code for a sales transaction may result in a Chargeback and/or the termination of your Agreement. Authorisation Approval Codes can be obtained through your POS Terminal or a Voice Response Unit (“VRU”) or a Call Centre representative. Any fees related to Authorisations will be charged for a request for an Authorisation Approval Code, whether or not the transaction is approved.

(b) Do not attempt to obtain an Authorisation Approval Code provided by someone other than us. If a Cardholder or another service provider provides you with either an Authorisation number or with a telephone number for obtaining Authorisations, the Authorisation Approval Code you receive may not be valid. Even if the transaction is initially processed and funded, it may be charged back at a later date. Also, if you receive a purported Authorisation Approval Code from someone other than us, we will not have the supporting records and will be unable to verify that you received the Authorisation if that is later questioned in a Chargeback.

(c) An Authorisation Approval Code only indicates the availability of credit on an account at the time the Authorisation is requested. It does not warrant that the person presenting the Card is the rightful Cardholder, nor is it a promise or guarantee that you will not be subject to a Chargeback.

(d) If you receive a Referral response to an attempted Authorisation, you may not submit the transaction without calling for and receiving a voice Authorisation. After receiving a Referral response you may not attempt another Authorisation on the same Card through your POS Terminal.

(e) If you fail to obtain an Authorisation Approval Code or if you submit a Card transaction after receiving a decline (even if a subsequent Authorisation attempt results in an Authorisation Approval Code), your transaction may be assessed fines or fees by the Card Associations for which you will be responsible. To avoid these costs, always obtain an Authorisation Approval Code directly from your terminal before submitting a transaction for settlement.

(f) You may not attempt to obtain multiple Authorisations for a single transaction. If a sale is declined, do not take alternative measures with the same Card to obtain an approval of the sale from other Authorisation sources. Instead, request another form of payment. If you accept and process a transaction that was declined, or attempt multi- transactions and/or multi-Authorisations, you are subject to a Chargeback, Association Fines and/or cancellation of your Agreement.

 5.2  AUTHORISATIONS VIA INTERNET

If you use the internet to obtain an Authorisation Approval Code, all sales should be authorised through the internet and the Authorisation Approval Code captured and recorded via the internet. Authorisations through other methods will result in additional charges to you.

### 6 SUBMISSION/DEPOSIT OF SALES AND CREDIT RECEIPTS

6.1 SUBMISSION OF SALES FOR MERCHANTS OTHER THAN YOUR BUSINESS

You may present for payment only valid charges that arise from a transaction between a bona fide Cardholder and your business. If you deposit or attempt to deposit transactions that arise from sales between Cardholders and a different business than the one approved by us in our agreement with you, then the transaction may be charged back, we may suspend or debit funds associated with all such transactions, and we may immediately terminate your account and the Agreement.

6.2 TIMELINESS

Additionally, if you deposit via magnetic tape, electronic transmissions, or electronic draft capture terminal (EDC), and have contracted to send the actual Sales and Credit Receipts to us for microfilming and Retrieval, the Sales and Credit Receipts (Media) must be batched daily by register/ terminal following the procedures below. Failure to do so may result in a processing fee and/or a Chargeback due to our inability to retrieve the Media as requested by the Issuer.

(f) It is your responsibility to ensure that the actual Media is batched correctly and, depending on the terms of your Agreement, either securely stored at your location or sent to us. (In some cases, the actual Media is sent daily to your head office, and forwarded to us for microfilming.)

### 8 RETENTION OF RECORDS FOR RETRIEVALS AND CHARGEBACKS

8.1 RETAIN LEGIBLE COPIES

You must retain legible copies of all Sales and Credit Receipts or any other transaction records for a period of at least eighteen (18) months from the date of each transaction (for Visa and MasterCard) and 24 months (for CUP) and 36 months (for JCB) or any longer period as may be required by law or Association Rules from time to time.

8.2 PROVIDE SALES AND CREDIT RECEIPTS

You must provide all Sales and Credit Receipts or other transaction records recorded in accordance with the terms of this Agreement that may be requested by us within the lesser of five (5) Business Days or the short test time limits established by Association Rules. You are responsible for any deficiencies in Card transaction data transmitted or otherwise delivered to us.

8.3 ENSURE PROPER RETRIEVAL FULFILLMENT

To ensure proper Retrieval fulfillments and/or Chargeback processing, Sales and Credit Receipts must contain the full sixteen (16) digit account number and expiration date. Failure to retain this information could result in a future Chargeback to your account.

### 9 CHARGEBACKS

9.1 GENERALLY

Both the Cardholder and the Card Issuer have the right to question or dispute a transaction. If such questions or disputes are not resolved, a Chargeback may occur. A Chargeback is a Card transaction that is returned to us by the Card Issuer. As a result, we will debit your Settlement Account or settlement funds for the amount of the Chargeback. It is strongly recommended that, whenever possible, you contact the Cardholder directly to resolve a disputed transaction or Chargeback. You are responsible for all Chargebacks and related costs arising from your transactions.

9.2 TRANSACTION DOCUMENTATION REQUESTS

(a) In some cases, before a Chargeback is initiated, the Card Issuer will request a copy of the Sales Receipt, via a request for transaction documentation. We will forward the request to you. You must respond to the request within the time frame and manner set out in the request. We will then forward your response to the Card Issuer. If you fail to timely respond, we will so notify the Card Issuer and a Chargeback may result. Upon receipt of a transaction documentation request, immediately retrieve the requested Sales Receipt(s) using the following guidelines:

(i) Make a legible copy, centred on A4 paper (only one (1) Sales Receipt per page).

(ii)  Write the ‘case number’ from the request for transaction documentation on each copy.

(iii) If applicable, make copies of a hotel folio, car rental agreement, or mail/phone order form.

(iv)  If a Credit transaction has been processed, a copy of the Credit Receipt is also required.

(v) Letters are not acceptable substitutes for Sales Receipts.

(vi)  Fax or mail legible copies of the Sales Receipt(s) to the fax number or mail address provided on the request form.

(vii) If you fax your response, please set your fax machine to print your fax number and name on the documents that you send. We can use this information to help know immediately where the documentation received originated from and to know whom to contact in the event the transmission is not clear or complete.

(viii)  Additionally, please set the scan resolution on your fax machine to the highest setting. The higher resolution setting improves the clarity of characters and graphics on the Sales Receipts transmitted and helps reduce the number of illegible fulfilments and/or Chargebacks.

(b) If we do not receive a clear, legible and complete copy of the Sales Receipt within the timeframe specified on the request, you may be subject to a Chargeback.

(c) A handling fee may be charged by the Issuer and will be debited from your Settlement Account or settlement funds if, a transaction documentation request results from a difference in the following information on the Sales Receipt and the transmitted record: merchant name or an incorrect city, state, foreign country and/or transaction date.

(d) You need to respond to all transaction documentation requests within the specified timeframe indicated on the request, or you may be without recourse of a Chargeback. You must respond to all requests related to fraud investigations. Subsequent Chargebacks for “non receipt of requested item relating to a transaction for fraud request” cannot be contested or represented.

9.3 CHARGEBACK PROCESS

(a) Regardless of whether you respond to a transaction documentation request, a Chargeback may be debited to your Settlement Account for numerous reasons (see below). If the Card Issuer submits a Chargeback, we will send you a Chargeback notification, which may also include a request for transaction documentation. Due to the short time requirements imposed by MasterCard and Visa and CUP and JCB, it is extremely important that you respond to a Chargeback notification and transaction documentation request within the time frame set out in the notification. Do not process a Credit transaction once a Chargeback is received; the Card Issuer will credit the Cardholder’s account (unless the Chargeback is reversed).

(b) If the information you provide is both timely and, in our sole discretion, sufficient to warrant a representment of the transaction and/or reversal of the Chargeback, we will do so on your behalf. However, representment and/or reversal is ultimately contingent upon the Card Issuer and/or Cardholder accepting the transaction under applicable Association guidelines. Representment or reversal is not a guarantee that the Chargeback has been resolved in your favour.

(c) For Visa Chargebacks, if we reverse the Chargeback and represent the transaction to the Card Issuer, the Card Issuer, at its sole discretion, may elect to submit the matter for arbitration before Visa. Visa may charge a fee for which you will be responsible. If a decision is made in favour of the Cardholder and/or Card Issuer, and the Chargeback is upheld, you will be responsible for all such fees and any other applicable fees and penalties imposed by Visa; such fees and penalties will be debited from your Settlement Account or settlement funds, in addition to the Chargeback.

(d) If MasterCard refuses to accept our representment, it may resubmit the Chargeback. In such event, we will debit your Settlement Account or settlement funds for the Chargeback. You authorise us to do this. However, if you feel strongly that that it is an invalid Chargeback, we may, on your behalf and at your request, submit the matter for arbitration before MasterCard. MasterCard may charge a fee for which you will be responsible. If a decision is made in favour of the Cardholder and/or Card Issuer, and the Chargeback is upheld, you will be responsible for all such fees and any other penalties imposed by MasterCard; such fees and penalties will be debited from your Settlement Account or settlement funds, in addition to the Chargeback.

(e) If the Chargeback is not disputed within the applicable time limits set out by MasterCard or Visa regulations, reversal rights are lost. Our only alternative, on your behalf, is to attempt a “good faith collection” from the Card Issuer. This process can take from 30 to100 days. Good faith collections must meet the Card Issuer’s criteria (e.g., above a set dollar amount, usually your local currency equivalent of US$50; within a specified time limit; etc.). Sometimes Card Issuers will only accept good faith collections after assessing collection fees. A good faith collection is not a guarantee that any funds will be collected on your behalf. If the good faith collection case is accepted by the Card Issuer, you will receive the amount that we are able to recover from the Card Issuer (which may be reduced by fees Card Issuers sometimes impose for accepting good faith collection claims).

(f) Association Rules and regulations require that a merchant must make a good faith attempt and be willing and able to resolve any disputes directly with the Cardholder. Due to Association Rules, you may not re-bill a Cardholder after a Chargeback is received for that transaction, even with Cardholder Authorisation.

(g) We strongly recommend that you include a detailed rebuttal letter along with all pertinent documents when responding to a transaction request or a Chargeback notification (e.g., rental agreement, imprinted portion of the invoice or Sales Receipt; the portion signed by the Cardholder; and the area where the Authorisation codes, with amounts and dates, are located).

(h) Due to the short time frames and the supporting documentation necessary to successfully (and permanently) reverse a Chargeback in your favour, we strongly recommends the following:

(i) Avoid Chargebacks by adhering to the guidelines and procedures outlined in these Operating Procedures.

(ii)  If you do receive a Chargeback, investigate, and if you dispute the Chargeback, submit the appropriate documentation within the required time frame.

(iii) Whenever possible, contact the Cardholder directly to resolve the dispute.

(iv)  If you have any questions, call Customer Service.

9.4 CHARGEBACK REASONS

The following section outlines the most common types of Chargebacks. This list is not exhaustive. For ease of understanding, we have combined like Chargebacks into seven groupings. We have included recommendations on how to reduce the risk of Chargebacks within each group. These are recommendations only, and do not guarantee that you will be able to prevent Chargebacks.

(a) Authorisation Issues

The Following scenarios cold cause an Authorisation related Chargeback to occur :

 - No account number verification

 - Negative account number verification

 - Full Authorisation not obtained

 - Fraudulent transaction – no Authorisation

 - Fraudulent transaction prior to embossed valid date

 - Authorisation request declines

 - Expired Card

 - Early Warning Bulletin/JCB Stop List

 - Non-matching account number

 - Mail order transaction on expired or never issued account number.
To reduce your risk of receiving an Authorisation-related Chargeback:

(i) Authorise all transactions and use the proper method of Authorisation.

(ii)  A valid approval Authorisation response indicates the Card is valid and can be accepted for payment. An approval code is usually a 4-6 digit number, along with an Authorisation response of “approval.”

(iii) A decline Authorisation response indicates the Card should not be accepted for payment. Request a different form of payment from the Cardholder or do not release the merchandise.

(iv)  “Pick-up” Authorisation response from the Issuer indicates the Credit Card account number is lost or stolen.

The Credit Card should not be accepted for payment. Additionally, you can choose to retain the Credit Card and return it to the Acquirer for a reward. If you retain a JCB Card, you must return it to us as soon as possible, but in any case within 7 calendar days.

(v) Referral Authorisation response prompts you to call us for further instructions.

(b) Cancellations and Returns

The following scenarios cold cause a cancellation and return related chargeback to occur

 - Credit Transaction not processed

 - Cancelled recurring transaction

 - Cancelled guaranteed reservation

 - Advance deposit service

 - Cardholder not aware of your cancellation/return policies

To reduce your risk of receiving a cancellation and return related Chargeback:

(i) For recurring transactions – ensure your customers are fully aware of the conditions of this type of transaction.

(ii)  Process Credits daily.

(iii) All Credits must be applied to the account to which the debit originally posted.

(iv)  Pre-notify the Cardholder of billing within 10 days (domestic) and 15 days (international) prior to billing, allowing the Cardholder time to cancel the transaction.

(v) Do not continue to bill after proper cancellation or after receipt of Chargeback.

(vi)  Ensure proper disclosure of your refund policy is on the Sales Receipt, the words “No Exchange, No REFUND,” etc. must be clearly printed on the Sales Receipt (or electronic equivalent, i.e., the receipt printed when a Card is swiped through a terminal) near or above the Cardholder’s signature.

(vii) Do not issue Credit in the form of a cheque.

(viii)  Do not issue in-store or merchandise Credit.

(ix)  For travel and entertainment transactions, provide the cancellation policy at the time of reservation.

(x) For Internet transactions ensure that there is an area on the web page where the Cardholder must acknowledge an understanding of the cancellation policy prior to completing the transaction.

(c) Fraud

The following scenarios could cause a fraud related Chargeback to occur

 - Unauthorised or fictitious account number

 - Fraudulent processing of a transaction

 - Fraudulent mail/phone order transaction

 - Counterfeit Transaction

 - Fraudulent transaction – no imprint obtained

 - Fraudulent transaction – no signature obtained

 - Risk Identification Service

 - Advance Deposit Service

To reduce your risk of receiving a fraud-related Chargeback:

(d) Non Receipt of Goods and Services

 - Services not rendered

 - Non receipt of merchandise

 - Advance Deposit Service

To reduce your risk of receiving a Non Receipt of Goods and Services related Chargeback:

(i) Do not process a transaction until the merchandise is shipped.

(ii)  Do not process any Credit Card transaction where the Cardholder has already paid for the goods or services using another method of payment.

(iii) Inform the cardholder of any specific cancellation policies or Advance Deposits.

(e) Processing Errors

The following scenarios could cause a processing error related Chargeback to occur

 - Incorrect transaction amount

 - Transaction amount changed

 - Merchandise paid by other means


(f) Quality of Goods and Services

The following scenarios could cause a Quality of Goods and Services related Chargeback to occur :

 - Defective merchandise

 - Not as described

To reduce your risk of receiving a Quality of Goods and Services related Chargeback:


(i) Ensure all merchandise is shipped properly.

Ensure all return policies are properly disclosed to the Cardholder at the time of sale.

(g) Non Receipt of Information

The following scenarios could cause a Non Receipt of Information related Chargeback to occur :

 - Transaction receipt not received

 - Copy illegible

 - Cardholder does not recognise transaction

 - T&E document not fulfilled

To reduce your risk of receiving a Non Receipt of Information related Chargeback:

(i) Prepare clean, legible Sales Receipts at the point of sale and send in your Media daily and/or respond to Media Retrieval requests within the required time frame (failure to properly respond to a fraud related Media Retrieval request eliminates any opportunity for a Chargeback reversal).

(ii)  Retain copies of transaction documents for at least eighteen (18) months from the original sales/post date (or any longer period as may be required under law).
(iii) Ensure that the most recognisable merchant name, location, and/or customer service phone number is provided on all transaction documentation.
