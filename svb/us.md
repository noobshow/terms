<section>
This Silicon Valley Bank Addendum ("SVB Addendum") to the Stripe Services Agreement ("Agreement") provides additional terms applicable to the Payment Services.  Any terms used but not defined in this SVB Addendum will have the meaning provided in the Agreement. 

This SVB Addendum constitutes a legal agreement between you, Stripe, and Silicon Valley Bank ("SVB").  In order to use the Payment Services provided through your Agreement with Stripe, you understand and agree that Stripe or SVB may enforce, and that SVB shall be an express third-party beneficiary of, any provisions of the Agreement that relate to your use of Payment Services provided in conjunction with SVB.  Stripe or SVB may also terminate this SVB Addendum at any time, which may limit or terminate your ability to use Payment Services.

**You must accept all of the terms and conditions of this Addendum to use Payment Services provided by Stripe under this Addendum.  If you do not accept them, you may not use these Payment Services under this Addendum.**

### 1. Purpose of this Addendum

When your customer pays you through Stripe, they have the option of paying you through a funding source offered on the Stripe website including a credit or debit card funded payment.  Since you may be the recipient of a credit or debit card funded payment, Visa U.S.A., Inc. and Visa International ("Visa"), and MasterCard International Incorporated ("MasterCard") (collectively the "Networks") require that you enter into a direct contractual relationship with a bank that is a member of the Networks.  However, by using Payment Services you are not establishing a depository or other account with SVB.  

SVB is not responsible for the provision of any Services by Stripe or your use of the Services for your business.  SVB is also not responsible for providing customer service to you to resolve any issues you may have related to your use of the Services; however, as described in Section 13, you should contact SVB in the event that you are unable to resolve any complaints directly with Stripe.  You are solely responsible for providing support to your Customers for all issues related to your products and services.

### 2. Compliance with Network Rules

Where you use the Payment Services to accept Charges from payment cards, you will comply with the Network Rules and limitations on use identified in the Agreement, including the Network Rules applicable to acceptance of MasterCard and Visa branded payment cards.  These include guidelines, monitoring programs, and activity reporting (including excessive credits, chargebacks, or deposit).  Under the Network Rules, certain activity may subject you to chargebacks, fees, fines, settlement delays, withholdings, audits of your processing activity, or termination of this SVB Addendum.  Without limiting the foregoing, you specifically agree to:

a.	Only submit transactions authorized by the cardholder;

b.	Only accept payment for the sale of products or services, and receipt of bona fide donations, conducted by you pursuant to your business as indicated on your application and not for any Prohibited Business;

c.	Submit a transaction for the full amount owed by the Customer for the transaction except where you and the Customer agree on a partial shipment (such as receiving a portion of an order), or where the transaction qualifies for delayed delivery or special order deposits (such as paying for a deposit on a custom-built product);

d.	Not establish minimum or maximum amounts (except as permitted by the Network Rules), or condition Charges for use of payment cards, and not discourage the use of one payment card brand over another;

e.	Not impose surcharges or taxes (except where permitted by Law and the Network Rules) and, where so done, you will only collect such amounts as part of the submitted Charge;

f.	Use Networks' logos or marks in a manner permitted by the Network Rules;

g.	Prohibit use of payment cards for disbursement of cash (except as permitted by the Network Rules);

h.	Comply with the security obligations identified in the Agreement, including compliance with PCI-DSS and only using cardholder data as permitted, and will certify such compliance upon request, and not permit or promote fraudulent use of payment cards or cardholder data;  

i.	Make clear to Customers that they are transacting with you prior to, during, and after the transaction, including providing clear statement descriptors;

j.	Use all reasonable methods to resolve disputes with your customers, including those resulting in a chargeback, and not attempt to recharge a customer for the transaction unless authorized by the Customer; and

k.	Provide clear refund and exchange language that is consistent with Laws and the Network Rules.

### 3. Authorization for Handling of Funds.

You authorize Stripe to instruct SVB on how and when Transfers of funds received from payment card networks should be made.  You further agree that you have no right to direct SVB to distribute settlement funds, and that you may not assign any interest in any funds held at SVB.  Any authorizations set forth in this SVB Addendum will remain in full force and effect until your Stripe Account is closed or terminated.

### 4. Sharing of Data

a.	You authorize Stripe and SVB to provide any Data, including User Data or Payment Data, to each other to (i) provide the services described in the Stripe Services Addendum or this SVB Addendum to you, (ii) comply with its legal and regulatory obligations, and (iii) perform underwriting and risk review, including verification that you are legally permitted to transact and receive funds. This includes sharing information you previously provided to SVB (or Stripe) and information about SVB's (or Stripe's) experience with you, such as termination of this SVB Addendum by SVB and the reasons for such termination.  Where required to comply with our legal, payment network, or regulatory obligations, SVB may provide any Data to law enforcement, payment networks or regulators (as the case may be). 

b.	SVB may use Payment Data that is anonymized and aggregated with other merchants' transaction data for internal purposes and to provide you, other merchants, and third parties with analytic products and services. 

### 5. Term and Termination

This SVB Addendum shall have the same effective date as the Agreement and shall continue so long as you use the Payment Services under this Addendum.  This SVB Addendum will terminate automatically upon termination of the Agreement, except for those terms which are intended to survive termination.  In addition, the Payment Services and/or this SVB Addendum may be terminated at any time by SVB immediately upon notice to you.
