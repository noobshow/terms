## BACS Direct Debit Request Service Agreement {#direct-debit}
    
### 1. Debiting your account

In the event that the net activity in your account on a day is negative or Stripe needs you to fund your account for any other reason relating to the [Stripe Services Agreement](https://stripe.com/legal), you authorise and request Stripe to debit your Bank Account by using the Bankers' Automated Clearing Services (BACS).

Transfers to your Bank Account will come from Stripe (Service User Number: 714613) and the timing of the transfers will be according to your Payout Schedule.

You will be sent an e-mail confirmation of the direct debit set-up within three working days of you setting up your account.

If you'd like details in advance of transfers (both debits and credits), Stripe offers this as a service that you can subscribe to.

### 2. Your responsibilities

It's your responsibility to:

(a) Check whether or not your Bank Account can accept debit and credit transfers through BACS;

(b) Ensure that your account has sufficient funds to allow for a debit transfer; and

(c) Check your bank statement account details and to verify that all amounts are correct.

If transfers are returned to Stripe by your bank, we may charge you a fee according to your Fee Schedule, in addition to any fees your bank may charge. If a debit transfer is returned to Stripe because your Bank Account has insufficient funds, it is your responsibility to fund the Bank Account so that we can re-process the debit transfer.
