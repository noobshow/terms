# Direct Debit Authority &mdash; New Zealand

In the event that the net activity in your account on a day is negative or Stripe needs you to fund your account for any other reason relating to the Agreement, you authorise and request Stripe to use Direct Debit to debit your bank account. Direct debit requests will be initiated by Stripe (Authorisation Code: 0228196). You acknowledge and accept that your bank accepts this authority on the conditions set out below.

If you’d like details in advance of transfers (both debits and credits), Stripe offers this as a service that you can subscribe to via the Stripe management dashboard.

This authority does not act as an assignment or agreement.

**Duration and termination**

You may terminate this authority at any time with respect to future payments by giving written notice of termination to Stripe and your bank. You may also stop payment of any Direct Debit to be initiated under this authority by giving written notice to your bank prior to the Direct Debit being paid by your bank.

You acknowledge that this authority will remain in full force and effect in respect of all Direct Debits passed to your account in good faith despite your death, bankruptcy or other revocation of this authority, until actual notice of such event is received by your bank.

**Inquiries, Errors, and Disputes**

If you believe there has been an error in debiting your account, you should notify Stripe at support@stripe.com. If there has been an error, Stripe will arrange with your bank to adjust your account and Stripe will notify you of the amount of the adjustment. If Stripe does not find an error, it will respond to your query with evidence of the correctness of the transfer.

**Your bank**

You acknowledge that:

(a) This authority is subject to any arrangement that may exist between you and your bank in relation to your account.

(b) Any dispute as to the correctness or validity of an amount debited to your account shall not be the concern of your bank except in so far as the Direct Debit has not been made in accordance with this authority. Any other disputes lie between you and Stripe.

(c) Where your bank has used reasonable care and skill in acting in accordance with this authority, the bank accepts no responsibility or liability in respect of the accuracy of information about Direct Debits on bank statements, or for any variations between notices given by Stripe and the amounts of the Direct Debits.

(e) Your bank is not responsible for, or under any liability if you do not receive advance notice of a Direct Debit. In any such situation the dispute lies between you and Stripe.

Your bank may:

(a) In its absolute discretion conclusively determine the order of priority of payment by it of any monies pursuant to this or any other authority, cheque or draft properly executed by you and given to or drawn on the bank.

(b) At any time terminate this authority as to future payments by notice in writing to you.

(c) Change its current fees for this service in force from time to time.

**Privacy**

Information relating to this Direct Debit authority will be treated according to [Stripe's Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).
