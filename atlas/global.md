# Stripe Atlas Agreement

This Stripe Atlas Agreement ("Agreement") is a contract between the legal entity formed pursuant to your participation in Stripe Atlas ("Legal Entity"), as well as the founder and/or promoter of such entity in his or her individual capacity ("Founder")(Collectively, Founder and Legal Entity are referred to as "you", "your", or "user"), Stripe, and Stripe GEP, Inc. ("SGEP"). Collectively Stripe and SGEP are referred to as "we", "our", or "us".  

As used in this Agreement, the term "Stripe Atlas Service" means the services provided by SGEP through a collaboration among Stripe and various services providers ("Service Providers") as described in this Agreement, the documentation provided on the [Stripe Atlas website](https://stripe.com/atlas), the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com), the [Stripe Atlas documentation]( https://stripe.com/docs), and in any communications sent to you by Stripe (collectively, "Stripe Atlas Documentation"). The term "Services" is defined in the [Stripe Services Agreement](https://stripe.com/us/legal) ("Services Agreement"), and, for clarity, the Stripe Atlas Service is a "Service". This Agreement, as well as the Services Agreement (which is incorporated by reference), govern your use of the Stripe Atlas Service, and the Services Agreement applies to and governs any Services (in addition to the Stripe Atlas Services) that you may use.

By completing the Stripe Atlas application and/or using the Stripe Atlas Service, you acknowledge and agree that the Stripe Atlas Service is for commercial purposes only and you will not use the Stripe Atlas Service for personal, family, or household use.


The person executing this Agreement on your behalf represents that he or she is 18 years of age or older, that all the information provided to us is accurate and complete, and that he or she is authorized to agree to this Agreement on your behalf. If this Agreement is entered into before incorporation of the Legal Entity, once incorporated, the Legal Entity must expressly accept and assume all rights and obligations under this Agreement through a duly adopted resolution of its board of directors or in another manner reasonably acceptable to Stripe.  

###1. Relationship to Other Agreements

Use of the Stripe Atlas Service binds you to this Agreement and the Services Agreement, and to any updates or modifications to each we may make from time to time. To the extent that there is a conflict between the Services Agreement and this Agreement related to your use of the Stripe Atlas Service, this Agreement will prevail. Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in this Agreement are defined in the Services Agreement.

###2. The Stripe Atlas Service and Service Providers

**a. Overview:** The Stripe Atlas Service is an online platform that enables accepted users to access Service Providers who can assist with: (i) the formation of a business entity, (ii) the application for and creation of a Deposit Account, (iii) information about the U.S. tax and legal systems, and (iv) any additional services that we may decide to provide from time to time as described through the Stripe Atlas Documentation. 

**b. Information Required:** Each Founder will complete an application provided by Stripe ("Stripe Atlas Application") requesting information necessary to apply for a Stripe Atlas account, a Deposit Account, and a Stripe account. 

More specifically, you must provide, and we will collect, detailed information about your business, including but not limited to: (i) details on your product, business model, and flow of funds, (ii) personal information about each of your representatives and beneficial owners, and (iii) business information for both any newly formed U.S. entity as well as any U.S. or foreign parent entity including legal name, address, tax identification number, and constituent documents. We may also collect financial and operational information about your business for the purpose of filing a BE-13 Claim for Exemption (Survey of New Foreign Direct Investment in the United States) with the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis.

**c. Verification and Underwriting:** We will attempt to verify the information you provide using various programmatic and manual methods of review. This may include verification of personal identification and beneficial ownership, denied persons or parties checks, and other efforts to verify the legitimacy of business entities who are beneficial owners. 

We are required to comply with laws intended to help prevent the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities. These laws require all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies businesses and persons to whom we provide services. 

The information you provide to us in the Stripe Atlas Application, including your name, address, date of birth, and other information, allows us to identify you. All or portions of this information may also be provided to the Bank. 

You acknowledge that the collection and use of information about you is used to facilitate the opening process for your Stripe Atlas account, Deposit Account, and Stripe account. You hereby direct Stripe to transmit the information in the Stripe Atlas Application to the Bank to expedite your application for a Deposit Account. 

At any point and for any reason, we may require additional information from you to verify your identity, the nature and ownership of your business, or to evaluate the risk of doing business with you. You will have no recourse, and we will have no liability, if upon evaluation of your Stripe Atlas Application or any related information, either we or any of our partners or collaborators in Stripe Atlas decline to do business with you. 

**d. Entity Formation; Registered Agent:** When your Stripe Atlas Application has been approved and you have signed the documents required to set up the Legal Entity, the Incorporation Service will form a Delaware entity based on the information provided in your Stripe Atlas Application. As part of the Stripe Atlas Service, you authorize Rocket Lawyer, or another Delaware registered agent designated by Stripe to serve as your Delaware registered agent ("Registered Agent") when the Legal Entity is formed. As of the Last Updated date indicated above, Rocket Lawyer is the Incorporation Service and Registered Agent providing these services as part of the Stripe Atlas Service. The [Rocket Lawyer Terms of Service](https://www.rocketlawyer.com/registered-agent-terms-of-service-for-stripe-atlas-customers.rl) will apply as between you and Rocket Lawyer to the extent that you are the recipient of services provided by Rocket Lawyer, including any business filings, registered agent, and limited mail forwarding services.  You are solely and exclusively responsible for updating your address, contact, and other business information with the Registered Agent through your Stripe Atlas account or by contacting Stripe Atlas (atlas@stripe.com). 

The Rocket Lawyer Terms of Service provide that Registered Agent services will automatically renew, and you are obliged to pay renewal fees for any renewal period. You may cancel the Registered Agent's appointment at any time by providing us with 30 days advance notice to (atlas@stripe.com)[mailto:atlas@stripe.com]. However, if you exercise this cancellation right, the Registered Agent may remain your registered agent until you appoint a new registered agent, and you will be responsible for the Registered Agent's fees until such time as this occurs. If your entity is dissolved, either voluntarily or involuntarily, it is your responsibility to notify us of this dissolution so that we may inform the Registered Agent of this fact. If you cancel the Registered Agent's appointment, or the appointment is otherwise terminated, you will not receive a refund for any prepaid fees, including fees for the time period between cancellation or termination and the appointment of a new registered agent. If you do not make full payment when due, your Registered Agent services may be terminated. You agree to bear any risk and under no circumstances will we or the Registered Agent be liable or responsible for any damage or inconvenience caused or alleged to be caused by termination of the Registered Agent services.

**e. Bank Account:** You direct SGEP to provide the Bank with all requisite formation and constituent documents and all personal and tax identification information necessary to open and maintain a Deposit Account.

After SGEP transmits your Stripe Atlas Application to the Bank, the Bank will review the application using its own criteria, including its prudential standards, anti-money laundering program, and other regulatory obligations. You must meet the Bank’s eligibility criteria before the Bank will open a Deposit Account for you. You acknowledge that the Bank may have separate documentation and disclosures for you to review and sign prior to opening a Deposit Account ("Deposit Agreement").
	
You must direct any service or support questions relating to your Deposit Account to the Bank for resolution. You acknowledge that Stripe is not responsible for any of your service or support questions relating to your Deposit Account. 

In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Deposit Agreement, the Deposit Agreement will control with respect to the Deposit Account provided by Bank.

**f. Professional Information:**As part of the Stripe Atlas Service, you will receive access to a U.S. Tax Considerations Guide prepared by PwC. You will also receive access to a U.S. Legal Considerations Guide and Forms prepared by Orrick to assist with incorporation and post-incorporation legal considerations. You acknowledge that such tax and legal resources are available solely for informational and educational purposes and do not constitute tax or legal advice.

**a. General:** You consent to our disclosure of the Data you provide to us including your name and address, and information about the transactions that you process through the Services to the Bank and other Service Providers, to facilitate providing the Stripe Atlas Services to you.
