With Amex Express Checkout, Card Members simply use their existing americanexpress.com User ID and Password, and American Express auto-fills the checkout fields with their American Express Card details and relevant account information in just a few clicks.

### 7. AXP as a Third-Party Beneficiary

In addition, the indemnified parties set forth in Section 5 of this American Express Addendum, are the intended third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to enforce this American Express Addendum. The Agreement will not be deemed to create any other rights, benefits or interest of any in third party, including supplier and Customers, or to create any obligations to such third parties.

### 7. Governing Law, Arbitration

You agree that any claims brought by AXP, as a third-party beneficiary under this American Express Addendum, or by you against AXP, is subject to the laws of the State of New York, without consideration of conflicts of law principles.

In case AXP exercises its rights as a third-party beneficiary under this American Express Addendum or you bring a claim against AXP, the following arbitration process shall apply between you and AXP:

**a. Procedures:** Any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or related to this American Express Addendum will be submitted for binding arbitration. Unless you and AXP agree otherwise, any arbitration shall take place in the State of New York, New York County, and will be administered by, and pursuant to the rules of, the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").

**b. Process:** Disputes will be arbitrated on an individual basis. There will be no right or authority for any disputes to be arbitrated on a class action basis or in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or other persons or entities similarly situated. The arbitrator's authority to resolve disputes and to make awards is limited to disputes between you and AXP alone. Furthermore, disputes brought by either you or AXP against the other may not be joined or consolidated in arbitration with disputes brought by or against any third party, unless agreed to in writing by both parties. No arbitration award or decision on any disputes will be given preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a party to the arbitration.

**c. Costs of Arbitration Proceedings:** The parties to such arbitration will be responsible for paying their respective shares of the arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees) as provided by AAA rules

**d. Applicability:** Without limiting the forgoing, but for clarification, this Section 7 of the American Express Addendum only affects disputes between you and AXP. Any disputes between you and Stripe are strictly governed by the applicable terms of the Agreement.

### 8. Implementation Guidelines

You will adhere to the following implementation guidelines and requirements:

**a.** All allowable graphics for the AEC button are available in the [Documentation]( https://stripe.com/docs/amex-express-checkout), and you may not resize, recolor or modify any graphics provided.

**b.** For radio button instances: Primary implementation is for you to leverage the payment mark in tandem with copy _Amex Express Checkout_. Secondary implementation is to leverage the button in tandem with copy _Amex Express Checkout_. Tertiary implementation is to leverage the copy _Amex Express Checkout_ on its own. You may not deviate from correct spelling and styles for _Amex Express Checkout_. Incorrect examples include, but are not limited to, __AMEX Express Checkout_ or _American Express Checkout_ or _Amex Checkout_.

**c.** You may not use any other AXP trademarks or graphics (i.e., payment acceptance mark or blue box logo) instead of the approved button asset. Payment acceptance marks on a Merchant Site (as differentiated from the AEC button) should always be the blue box logo.

**d.** The AEC button must always be clickable where implemented. You may not use the AEC button in place of a payment acceptance mark or blue box logo on your website or app.

**e.** Ideal placement of the AEC button is prior to the majority of manual entry fields, to take full advantage of the autofill capability.

### 9. Termination

For the avoidance of doubt, you may terminate this American Express Addendum by removing the AEC button from your website or app, and ceasing to use AEC and all AXP Property. This will constitute notice to AXP your termination. AXP will have the right to suspend or terminate provision of AXP Property under this American Express Addendum at any time.
